2019-12-31 00:23:49 <fizzie> I think that reply had the hidden message "hi" cleverly concealed within it.
2019-12-31 00:35:40 <zzo38> We were trying to go into the wizard's tower, but there was no friction on the roof so we keep falling down, and the windows have some kind of magical force field. But we were able to break the force field with arrows, and then go in and not only the magic orb we needed, but there are also books in there, which was helpful since we can use that information to disable most of the clay golems even though we are not near them.

2019-12-31 03:17:18 <zzo38> Even though people have said that targets in a cost in Magic: the Gathering will not work, and it is certainly not designed to do this, I think it does work (if it is a spell or a activated ability other than a mana ability); for example if it says "{T}, Destroy target creature: You gain 2 life." then you won't gain 2 life if the target creature is successfully destroyed. Since the targets are chosen before the cost is paid, it might work.

2019-12-31 06:11:13 <zzo38> If a map or dictionary contains a false entry for a copyright trap, then what will happen if the other people who read it then make it true? Such as, if there is a nonexistent street, build that street; if a dictionary contains a made up word, start using that word a lot.
2019-12-31 06:11:16 <esowiki> 14[[07Keg14]]4 10 02https://esolangs.org/w/index.php?diff=68500&oldid=68493 5* 03JonoCode9374 5* (+102) 10
2019-12-31 06:21:06 <zzo38> Wiktionary also lists the word "malamorous", which doesn't mention anything about a copyright trap, but says that the word is not used anywhere, only being listed in a book titled "1000 Words You Should Use More Often".
2019-12-31 06:34:45 <kingoffrance> there's an obi wan street;  i suppose they like advertising
2019-12-31 06:34:57 <kingoffrance> i dunno if they got "permission" first or not
2019-12-31 06:36:23 <zzo38> Maybe, but that isn't what I meant. I meant when they put false streets in a map to detect those who make copies of the map and violate their copyright. If the street actually exists, then the map will be correct that such excuse might not count.
2019-12-31 06:38:31 <zzo38> (Or in the case of a dictionary, the case for including it in other dictionaries if it is commonly in use may be even stronger, so it is a real fact and they might not be able to sue them for copyright violation if the word is in use since a fact in a dictionary is presumably uncopyrightable.)
2019-12-31 06:38:58 <kingoffrance> ah, like a disguised "watermark"
2019-12-31 06:39:52 <kingoffrance> i was wondering what you meant by "coyright trap" yeah i have heard of such
2019-12-31 06:40:44 <kingoffrance> some mayor sees it, decides they will call somewhere "new malamorous city" not knowing the original doesn't actually exist :)
2019-12-31 06:40:54 <kingoffrance> s/sees it/sees it in an atlas/
2019-12-31 06:44:11 <zzo38> Yes, I suppose something like that can happen, although that isn't what I meant either, unless the new city is built in the same place where the original presumably (but actually isn't) was.
2019-12-31 07:13:38 <kingoffrance> surely you will invent a word for such an occasion
2019-12-31 07:13:41 <kingoffrance> surely
2019-12-31 07:14:16 <int-e> Shirley?
2019-12-31 07:20:21 <kingoffrance> that would do
2019-12-31 07:47:24 <b_jonas> zzo38: then the word will no longer work as a copyright trap after that

2019-12-31 07:51:20 <kingoffrance> malamorous if it means what i suppose, sounds to me like glamorous i.e. deception; although modern connotations is perhaps reversed, i.e. shining star to follow rather than "blinding light gypsy trickery"
2019-12-31 07:51:45 <kingoffrance> i was thinking "mal" + "amorous" but glamorous actually makes sense to me, if that is what it is getting at
2019-12-31 07:51:46 <b_jonas> zzo38: there was a different case for copyright trap that I was considering. some bus companies here publish their official bus timetable in a format that is hard to use,
2019-12-31 07:52:23 <kingoffrance> i would be curious who/how they made up "malamorous"
2019-12-31 07:53:09 <b_jonas> so there's a market for more usable digital timetables on the internet. in such a timetable, you can put a copyright trap by nudging the stop time of a single bus in a small station forward by a minute. that's easy to detect when someone copies your presentation, and won't affect users much.
2019-12-31 07:55:09 <kingoffrance> (i.e. even if malamorous was a bogus word, how did they come up with its meaning, etc.)
2019-12-31 07:55:26 <kingoffrance> cuz they had to somewhat make it sound real, unless it was just in a list without any def.
2019-12-31 07:57:10 <zzo38> I don't know if maybe the author of the book just made it up because they hoped someone might use it.
2019-12-31 07:59:29 <b_jonas> in the case of a database where the individual items are under public domain but your compilation is protected by database right (a dictionary is a stronger example than that, you could consider artefacts in a museum, or works of art of a famous musician, or books in a library), another way to add a copyright trap is to omit the entry for an item that definitely exists
2019-12-31 08:01:22 <zzo38> Yes; and if they do that then you can complain to them about an item is missing.
2019-12-31 08:03:38 <kingoffrance> thats good, because you just add it and remove something else
2019-12-31 08:03:44 <kingoffrance> i like that idea b_jonas
2019-12-31 08:03:57 <kingoffrance> harder to do now with computers of course
2019-12-31 08:04:53 <zzo38> If they do just add it and remove something else, and then repeat the complaint about the new missing item, and so on, then eventually they will have a bad reputation, I think.

2019-12-31 08:39:14 <b_jonas> suppose I have a photo that I want to publish on a website in jpeg format. the website is a proper one that lets me publish the jpeg file byte to byte without changes, not eg. facebook or twitter. before publishing, I want to put a metadata field into the file that contains the website url where the published image and its description will be found when I publish, so that if someone downloads the file,
2019-12-31 08:39:20 <b_jonas> they have a backlink. what metadata field should I use for that? I was trying to look at descriptions of IPTC but they're so arcane I couldn't find the right field. I don't insist on IPTC in particular, but I do insist on JPEG as the container.
2019-12-31 08:49:17 <b_jonas> this is for when I can predict a direct url on the website, such as on Mediawiki wikis, as opposed to websites that only allow urls with a random id (or a crypto checksum) in them
