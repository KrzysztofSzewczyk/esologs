2019-12-22 00:23:21 <b_jonas> int-e: hmm, that would make the first F stand for "fast" rather than the second
2019-12-22 00:24:10 <b_jonas> int-e: the complication is that zzo38 has some pixel image processing utilities that are also named "ff", but they're named of "Farbfeld", which is an entirely logical name for processing pixel images
2019-12-22 00:24:35 <b_jonas> only ffmpeg also mostly processes pixel images and videos made of them, though it also processes audio
2019-12-22 00:24:40 <b_jonas> (I'm encoding audio using it right now)
2019-12-22 00:26:23 <int-e> wait that's another Fabrice Bellard child?
2019-12-22 00:26:28 <imode> yup.
2019-12-22 00:27:58 <int-e> So https://ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-devel/2006-February/010315.html is to be taken as gospel.
2019-12-22 00:28:45 <int-e> (And that also kind of make sense... skipping forward in a video stream isn't trivial after all.)
2019-12-22 00:28:51 <int-e> *makes
2019-12-22 00:42:55 <zzo38> Anyways the names of the Farbfeld Utilities programs do not match those of FFmpeg, I think
2019-12-22 00:43:44 <b_jonas> zzo38: yeah. it's not too hard, I think ffmpeg only has three executable names: ffmpeg, ffprobe, ffplay
2019-12-22 00:44:04 <b_jonas> (plus there's three shadow copies in the old fork that is IIRC called avutils, but those don't start with ff)
2019-12-22 00:44:22 <b_jonas> int-e: ok, so the "fast forward" was right
2019-12-22 00:44:33 <b_jonas> I wonder why they changed it to the euphemistic "hyper fast" then
2019-12-22 01:09:50 <zzo38> The web page for 3rd Party Applications for Icecast lists some media players that can play back Icecast streams, although Firefox also plays back Icecast streams just fine, and piping curl to SoX also works fine for playing back Icecast streams.
