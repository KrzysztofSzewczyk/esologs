2020-10-13 00:17:04 <user3456> I tried reading the docs and couldn't get it to work :/
2020-10-13 00:18:05 <Arcorann> https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Templates <-- this?
2020-10-13 00:19:29 <Arcorann> https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Extension:ParserFunctions <-- forgot, read this as well
2020-10-13 00:19:33 <user3456> oh
2020-10-13 00:20:36 <Arcorann> I was thinking of the #if function, forgot that it was a parser function
2020-10-13 00:20:41 <Arcorann> Well, it's not that important

2020-10-13 00:33:25 <user3456> I give up
2020-10-13 00:34:04 <user3456> btw fizzie you can delete the non CC0 image of the trash can
2020-10-13 00:38:28 <zzo38> I think that if you have a good justification to believe it, "Not much is known about this user, but from what can be seen from the esowiki irc bot this person is nothing more than a furry themed spambot" may be OK; if it is wrong, they can change it by themself, I think.

2020-10-13 00:46:41 <zzo38> But, yes, delete the non CC0 image of a trash can. If the image is used somewhere significantly, add a public domain one if you have one, I suppose

2020-10-13 03:53:30 <shachaf> Why does x86 have both "xchg r/m64, r64" and "xchg r64, r/m64" encodings?
2020-10-13 03:54:17 <shachaf> Oh, wait, it doesn't.
2020-10-13 03:54:48 <shachaf> Or rather they're both listed but they have the same encoding.
