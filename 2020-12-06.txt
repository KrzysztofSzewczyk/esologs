2020-12-06 01:08:39 <b_jonas> this will be the first Christmas that I won't be celebrating while being in person together with my brother. it's a bit sad.
2020-12-06 01:09:02 <b_jonas> we'll still have some internet stuff of course
2020-12-06 01:28:53 <fizzie> Oddly enough, we've spent the last five Christmases here in the UK without meeting any family, but now we're planning on doing the video call thing, even though we could've done that any of the past years.
