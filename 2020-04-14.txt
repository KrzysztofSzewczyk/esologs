2020-04-14 03:30:17 <zzo38> Is someone on today?
2020-04-14 03:31:06 * pikhq is, actually
2020-04-14 03:32:52 <zzo38> Is there a option in Firefox and/or other web browsers that cookies can be disabled except for redirects?
2020-04-14 03:33:07 <pikhq> I have not seen such an option, no
2020-04-14 03:34:06 <zzo38> What do you think of my idea of "fission" ability for Magic: the Gathering cards?
2020-04-14 03:35:39 <pikhq> I must say, I missed your discussion of it, so I can't say
2020-04-14 03:36:13 * pikhq should maybe get back into Magic after this is all over...
2020-04-14 03:36:49 <zzo38> Starts at UNIX timestamp 1586738893.
2020-04-14 03:37:33 <zzo38> Even if you are alone, you can still compose and/or solve puzzles of Magic: the Gathering, which is something I like to do.
2020-04-14 03:38:15 <pikhq> My wife knows how to play, but I'm more into it than her, and she's been preoccupied with Final Fantasy 7 lately
2020-04-14 03:38:44 <pikhq> otoh could do internet stuff
2020-04-14 03:38:47 <zzo38> Do you like puzzles of Magic: the Gathering?
2020-04-14 03:38:59 <pikhq> I have never really gotten into 'em
2020-04-14 03:39:16 <pikhq> For me a decent chunk of the appeal of Magic _is_ the fact you're playing with other people
2020-04-14 03:39:47 <pikhq> Like, yes, the game itself is appealing, but I also enjoy the social nature of it
2020-04-14 03:40:01 <zzo38> There are some free open source implementations of Magic: the Gathering; one I looked at (but never used; I only looked at the code) is Xmage, which does not implement text changing effects.
2020-04-14 03:40:14 <pikhq> Yeah, I've used some in the past
2020-04-14 03:41:25 <zzo38> I thought to implement a RDF-based format which can implement many features of Magic: the Gathering much better. So, that is my suggestion to someone who is implementing Magic: the Gathering.
2020-04-14 03:42:37 * pikhq wonders if she should rope her girlfriend into learning Magic :P
2020-04-14 03:42:56 <pikhq> Probably not, unless she waaaants to...
2020-04-14 03:43:45 <zzo38> You could ask if you want to, I suppose.
2020-04-14 03:44:10 * pikhq nods
2020-04-14 03:44:53 <zzo38> Chess (and many chess variants, too) can also easily be played by computer without specialized software, using IRC or a direct connection or whatever (or even by telephone, too, actually)
2020-04-14 03:45:24 <zzo38> Card games is more difficult to do by computer without the specialized software, but chess game can be done easily.
2020-04-14 03:45:31 <pikhq> Yeah, I mean, chess is trivial to do remotely.
2020-04-14 03:45:43 <pikhq> Correspondence chess has been a Thing for ages, after all
2020-04-14 03:46:56 <zzo38> Yes, it must have been. I don't know how old it is exactly, but I think it was even done by telegrams in the past
2020-04-14 03:47:24 <ais523> pikhq: I've basically given up on Magic as a game to play, as opposed to a game to theorize about
2020-04-14 03:47:41 <ais523> I've disliked the direction it's been going in for quite a while
2020-04-14 03:47:53 <pikhq> I've only played Magic in kitchen table formats, thankfully
2020-04-14 03:47:58 <zzo38> Dod you read my "fission" ideas about making a card that becomes two objects in the battlefield but only one outside (like the reverse of meld)?
2020-04-14 03:48:50 <zzo38> ais523: I don't like many of the features of the rules either (or some of the card designs), but in some cases I have thought of how to make a variant rules, trying to make it close to the official rules though
2020-04-14 03:51:38 <ais523> the basic problem is that Wizards are trying to make too many products for too many audiences, and are being pulled in too many directions and the quality has gone way down
2020-04-14 03:52:10 <zzo38> Although some of these rules aren't so new, and some of them they have fixed (for example, I didn't like the planeswalker redirection rule and I am glad they removed it), but one rule I dislike is names for tokens, which seems mathematically klugy to me in the way the spelling works. Subtypes should be a separate namespace from names and shouldn't interact in this way (with the possible exception of conventional basic lands).
2020-04-14 03:52:13 <ais523> actually, something similar to this is why I gave up on PokÈmon (the video game, not the card game, and not the video game /of/ the card game)
2020-04-14 03:52:52 <ais523> hmm, would "a land token named Island" tap for blue? my guess is no (but "an Island land token" would)
2020-04-14 03:53:02 * pikhq shrugs
2020-04-14 03:53:07 <zzo38> ais523: I agree with you about the land tokens.
2020-04-14 03:53:18 <pikhq> tbh my time is nevertheless likely to be occupied
2020-04-14 03:53:39 <zzo38> Since, "a land token named Island" still doesn't have the subtype Island, so it doesn't implicitly have "{T}: Add {U}".
2020-04-14 03:53:57 <ais523> anyway, the M:tG Busy Beaver people are apparently trying to figure out a way to create an Ackermann-like function only it has the busy beaver function rather than an increment
2020-04-14 03:54:14 <ais523> zzo38: right, I was just wondering whether there was a special rule for things named Island, or whether that only applies to cards
2020-04-14 03:54:31 <ais523> like, a card named Island implicitly has the Island subtype
2020-04-14 03:54:38 <ais523> if it's printed that way
2020-04-14 03:54:44 <ais523> due to how Oracle text works
2020-04-14 03:55:02 <ais523> but I guess that doesn't affect tokens that were created with the same name as a card due to Artificial Evolution
2020-04-14 03:55:09 <ais523> or even naturally
2020-04-14 03:55:30 <ais523> (IIRC think "Splinter" is both a card name, and a name of a token that can be created without text-changing effects)
2020-04-14 03:55:41 <zzo38> ais523: O, yes, that is a rule of Oracle text for conventional basic lands. And, yes, it won't affect tokens of course, or even cards, just, I should think it should mean, as far as the game is concerned, a card printed with a given name has the text specified by the Oracle text as its initial text.
2020-04-14 03:56:27 <zzo38> The exception I mentioned for conventional basic lands doesn't mean that names are subtypes, only that the name of "an Island land token" would compare as equal to the name of a card named "Island", but this isn't the case for creature tokens that are not explicitly given names (if they are explicitly given names, then they do compare equal to card names that are spelled the same way in English).
2020-04-14 03:57:03 <ais523> I think removing special cases would be helpful
2020-04-14 03:57:07 <ais523> `card-by-name Spreading Seas
2020-04-14 03:57:08 <HackEso> Spreading Seas \ 1U \ Enchantment -- Aura \ Enchant land \ When Spreading Seas enters the battlefield, draw a card. \ Enchanted land is an Island. \ ZEN-C
2020-04-14 03:57:48 <zzo38> That changes the subtype, not the name. It wouldn't change under the rules I mention.
2020-04-14 03:57:49 <ais523> my preferred templating for the second ability would be ´Enchanted land is an Island with "{T}: Add {U}" and no other subtypes or abilities.ª
2020-04-14 03:58:17 <ais523> as it is, there's a special rule that changing the subtype of a land removes all its abilities, and there's a special rule on the Island subtype to add the ability to tap for {U}
2020-04-14 03:59:07 <zzo38> Yes, those are special cases. The special rule about changing the subtype of a land removing all abilities I agree is a bit klugy, but the rule that those subtypes implicitly cause it to have those abilities is I think probably important to keep how it is.
2020-04-14 03:59:26 <ais523> the implicit rule for the Wall subtype got removed
2020-04-14 03:59:54 <zzo38> Yes, and that is good that they removed the rule for Wall.
2020-04-14 04:00:01 <pikhq> Yeah, that got swapped over to being an explicit ability, and thank goodness
2020-04-14 04:00:08 <pikhq> I don't like that sort of hidden magic in game design
2020-04-14 04:01:03 <zzo38> (Also, I mentioned "possible exception"; maybe my new rule should not have the exception for names of conventional basic lands. I am not sure. Either way, it won't affect non-conventional basic lands.)
2020-04-14 04:01:19 <ais523> I do like design guidelines like "black creatures are hard to destroy" but those don't have to be part of the game rules
2020-04-14 04:01:35 * pikhq nods
2020-04-14 04:02:03 <pikhq> That's the sort of thing you don't have to explain to people to learn the game, but will _inevitably_ pick up if they play enough
2020-04-14 04:02:22 <ais523> that's one thing that the PokÈmon video games do well, the power of something can be in how other things interact with it rather than in its own rules
2020-04-14 04:05:07 <ais523> although it can lead to things getting a little broken sometimes when the delicate chain of interactions breaks down
2020-04-14 04:05:18 <ais523> e.g. see https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/ask-a-simple-question-get-a-simple-answer-mark-ii-roa-edition.3468567/page-53#post-8317201 and the answer two posts below (I'm callforjudgement)

2020-04-14 04:05:37 <pikhq> Yeah...
2020-04-14 04:07:08 User Name: ais523 = ais523!~ais523@unaffiliated/ais523
2020-04-14 04:07:08 <ais523> the funny thing is that Arena Trap started off as a safety valve against one strategy, and ended up, many years later, making another strategy too strong by countering its counters
2020-04-14 04:07:33 <zzo38> There are some unofficial implementations of Pokemon battles too, with different generations.
2020-04-14 04:08:25 <zzo38> What does the Arena Trap ability do?
2020-04-14 04:08:51 <ais523> it prevents grounded opponents from switching out as long as the Arena Trap user is in battle, without the help of an item that ungrounds them (Air Balloon) or that allows them to ignore trapping effects (Shed Shell)
2020-04-14 04:09:02 <zzo38> OK
2020-04-14 04:09:41 <ais523> but all its users are very defensively vulnerable in order to compensate for the fairly good ability
2020-04-14 04:10:04 <ais523> so normally there's not much point in trapping the opponent with it because they just KO you and regain the ability to switch out that way
2020-04-14 04:12:40 <zzo38> OK
2020-04-14 04:12:49 <ais523> oh, I think the Run Away ability might also allow you to ignore trapping effects, not sure though, they keep changing what abilities do and most of the changes have been really good ideas, but it makes the rules hard to remember sometimes
2020-04-14 04:13:30 <zzo38> Well, just you should agree which generation you are playing, and then, you should use the rules for that generation, I should think. (With any alterations for the specific match, if any, I suppose.)
2020-04-14 04:14:05 <ais523> zzo38: I agree; it's just that there are eight generations now and trying to remember the rules for each of them is complicated
2020-04-14 04:14:42 <ais523> there was a really major rules change in generation 8 (the turn order isn't locked in at the start of the turn, rather it's recalculated for every PokÈmon that hasn't moved yet after each move) which I dislike
2020-04-14 04:14:56 <ais523> and which keeps catching me out in generation 8 battles
2020-04-14 04:15:44 <zzo38> Yes, I suppose it is difficult like you said.
2020-04-14 04:16:34 <zzo38> I thought turn order was based on speed? If that is how it work then I should think the result is same either way? Does it do another way?
2020-04-14 04:17:10 <ais523> zzo38: yes, based on speed
2020-04-14 04:17:28 <ais523> but say there are four PokÈmon on the battlefield and their speeds are in the order A, B, C, D
2020-04-14 04:17:44 <ais523> now if PokÈmon A uses a move to make PokÈmon D faster, it could go next if its speed is increased to now be faster than B's
2020-04-14 04:18:49 <ais523> whereas under the old rules, PokÈmon B and C would move next, then PokÈmon D, but the turn afterwards PokÈmon D would move sooner
2020-04-14 04:19:09 <zzo38> O, OK. Now I know what you mean.
2020-04-14 04:21:23 <ais523> the drawback of speed-boosting moves used to be that they did nothing on the turn you used them, and they were balanced accordingly, but now (except in battles with only two PokÈmon) there is very little counterplay to them, other than by building a team which would naturally go at the end of the turn order anyway (making the moves redundant)
2020-04-14 04:21:35 <ais523> so it's made battles much more matchup-dependent than they used to be
2020-04-14 04:22:12 <ais523> and means that many battles end up being decided by guesses made in the Team Preview phase
2020-04-14 04:23:33 <zzo38> OK
2020-04-14 04:25:24 <ais523> (generation 8 also invented Max Airstream, which is probably the most broken move ever in PokÈmon, and is speed-boosting, although oddly it's somehow even more broken in singles, where the changes to turn order calculation have no effect)
2020-04-14 04:26:26 <ais523> hmm, we could do with a PokÈmon video games version of `card-by-name, I guess, but probably these conversations don't come up often enough for it to be worth the programming effort

2020-04-14 04:28:06 <zzo38> I have thought of a system for custom Pokemon battles, involving various rule customization and time controls customization (the time controls is more general and can be applied to many different games).
2020-04-14 04:29:04 <ais523> there are simulators that understand a lot of custom rules already
2020-04-14 04:29:14 <ais523> although your rules might not be included
