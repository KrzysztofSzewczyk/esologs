2019-11-23 00:04:17 <Deraj> Apologies if this type of message is frowned upon, but I've been working on a programming game that uses an esoteric computer architecture (single instruction), and thought that #esoteric might be the best (only?) place to find people who might be interested in such things
2019-11-23 00:05:11 <Deraj> I just put up a page on the language (trying to follow all applicable policies!) and there is a link to the game at the end (under External Resources): https://esolangs.org/wiki/SIC-1_Assembly_Language
2019-11-23 00:07:04 <Deraj> Additionally, if anyone knows of any other esoteric programming games, please point me to them! For what it's worth, I've enjoyed Zachtronics's games (esp. TIS-100 -- which I'm surprised isn't represented on esolang!)

2019-11-23 00:11:17 <fizzie> We've definitely discussed TIS-100.
2019-11-23 00:11:42 <fizzie> (I finally bought SHENZHEN I/O the other day, now that it was 50% off.)
2019-11-23 00:15:22 <fizzie> As for other games, there's https://esolangs.org/wiki/Category:Programming_games
2019-11-23 00:15:48 <fizzie> BF Joust is played in sporadic bursts of activity, though it's been a long time since the last one.

2019-11-23 00:16:34 <fizzie> The others are probably not played. Well, except maybe Core War, that might still be going, it's the most well-known of them of course.

2019-11-23 00:22:25 <Deraj1> Heh, not sure how I missed the Programming Games category -- thanks!
2019-11-23 00:23:07 <Deraj1> And yeah, I ran across Core War a little while back, but never really gave it a try
2019-11-23 00:26:50 <Deraj1> @fizzie have you tried Shenzhen I/O yet? I'm wondering how it compares to TIS-100 (haven't gotten I/O yet)

2019-11-23 00:28:50 <fizzie> Not yet. But I know at least int-e and shachaf did.
2019-11-23 00:29:11 <shachaf> I only played a small amount of it.
2019-11-23 00:32:10 <Deraj1> shachaf, is that "only played a small amount because that's all I had time for" or "only played a small amount because it wasn't really what I was looking for"? :)

2019-11-23 00:41:17 <oerjan> if you're not surprised when it happens, it's not a good quote.
2019-11-23 00:42:10 <shachaf> Most of those quotes are borderline anyway.
2019-11-23 00:42:51 <oerjan> true enough. fungot gets a lot of slack due to his charisma and cute looks.

2019-11-23 00:56:38 <oerjan> hm Deraj also seems a little reversed. maybe they're invading.
