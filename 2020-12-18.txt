2020-12-18 01:50:21 <ais523> shachaf: zzo38: there is apparently an unofficial standard for gopher over TLS
2020-12-18 01:50:33 Joined: Lord_of_Life
2020-12-18 01:50:45 <ais523> it is very simple, too: you just make a TLS connection on port 70
2020-12-18 01:51:07 <ais523> (a gophers server distinguishes between gopher-over-TLS and regular gopher by checking to see whether the first thing the client sends is a TLS handshake)
2020-12-18 01:51:10 Quit: Lord_of_Life (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
2020-12-18 01:51:53 <shachaf> What's the thing with TLS where the server must identify all the domain names it possibly knows about and then the client checks whether it matches?
2020-12-18 01:51:54 Nick Change: Lord_of_Life -> Lord_of_Life
2020-12-18 01:52:02 <shachaf> Rather than the cient saying what domain name it thinks it's accessing.
2020-12-18 01:52:08 <shachaf> Seems bizarre to me.
2020-12-18 01:52:43 <ais523> sounds like one of the many variants of SNI
2020-12-18 01:52:53 <shachaf> TCP is presumably just a dead end if you want efficient networking protocols.
2020-12-18 01:53:04 <ais523> the basic problem is that in most TLS connections, the server name indication is sent in the clear, so anyone listening in knows what site you're connecting
2020-12-18 01:53:10 <ais523> and there have been various proposals to remedy that
2020-12-18 01:53:33 <shachaf> With TLS being one of the reasons.
2020-12-18 01:53:48 <shachaf> Hmm, I see, so eavesdroppers know whether I'm connecting to youtube.com vs. google.com or something.
2020-12-18 01:53:59 <ais523> the basic problem is that it's hard to deploy anything like this at a small scale, because with a small hosting company, you can normally figure out which site is being connected to simply from the IP
2020-12-18 01:54:09 <shachaf> I guess you might want to keep that information secret, especially with DNS becoming encrypted these days.
2020-12-18 01:54:20 <ais523> so in order to really keep it private, you need a wide range of different sites that are all hosted from the same IP so people aren't sure which is which
2020-12-18 01:54:43 <ais523> Cloudflare apparently added some sort of encrypted SNI recently, because they have the right sort of infrastructure for that
2020-12-18 01:55:42 <ais523> I'm a little surprised that gopher is still being developed nowadays (at least, within the last couple of years)
2020-12-18 01:56:01 <ais523> but apparently some people like it due to the lack of things like JavaScript-based adverts because the protocol can't handle them
2020-12-18 01:56:41 <shachaf> Gophers are OK but kitty cats are where it's at, if you ask me.
2020-12-18 01:57:11 <zzo38> I think that the web browser is the wrong place to implement encrypted DNS, since DNS is something that you will want many programs to use, not only the web browser.
2020-12-18 01:57:15 <ais523> well, cat has even fewer features than gopher
2020-12-18 01:57:50 <shachaf> Is QUIC a good alternative to TCP?
2020-12-18 01:59:23 <ais523> one issue I've discovered with TCP is that in practice, you seem to need to duplicate a lot of TCP functionality to get reliable connections even when you're using TCP
2020-12-18 01:59:33 <ais523> in real life, TCP connections have a tendency to break for no reason
2020-12-18 01:59:37 <ais523> this somehow even happens on localhost
2020-12-18 02:00:20 <ais523> using TLS over TCP increases the frequency at which this happens, but probably just because more data is sent
2020-12-18 02:01:28 <ais523> oh, an idea I had recently: an equivalent of HTTP headers but for files on a filesystem (e.g. in the directory entry for a file)
2020-12-18 02:01:42 <ais523> it struck me that HTTP headers are already a widely used standard for file metadata
2020-12-18 02:02:42 <zzo38> Actually, my "httpdirlist" format is similar, using the same format of HTTP headers to make a directory listing format for use with HTTP, with blank lines separating directory entries.
2020-12-18 02:03:42 <ais523> it strikes me as something of a security hole that I can't just put a file in a directory that a web browser serves, and know for certain that it won't get misinterpreted in a format I don't expect and that happens to do something malicious
2020-12-18 02:03:47 <zzo38> Perhaps having a file in that format might also be helpful for loading "file:" URLs in a web browser, so that it can know the MIME type of each file.
2020-12-18 02:04:06 <ais523> (e.g. there was an incident on #esoteric a while ago where someone managed a successful XSS attacks against the raw log files, even though they're plaintext)
2020-12-18 02:06:31 <zzo38> Yes, but you should fix the HTTP server to specify the correct MIME type, presumably always text/plain for the raw log files
2020-12-18 02:06:59 <ais523> yes, but some browsers will override the MIME type if it appears to be wrong
2020-12-18 02:08:02 <ais523> nowadays there is ´X-Content-Type-Options: nosniffª which tells the browser that the MIME type is correct and should not be changed
2020-12-18 02:09:13 <zzo38> Use that, then, although I should think that the web browser should never override the MIME type specified by the server unless the user explicitly specifies a different MIME type
2020-12-18 02:11:24 <ais523> apparently this option is not respected by IE < 8
2020-12-18 02:11:36 <ais523> so there would still be a potential for XSS attacks against plaintext files on IE7 and earlier
2020-12-18 02:11:39 <ais523> (does anyone still use those?)
2020-12-18 02:14:34 <zzo38> I don't know
2020-12-18 02:16:34 <shachaf> ais523: What about HFS forks?
2020-12-18 02:18:05 <ais523> shachaf: Mac filesystems have something similar to the HTTP idea I had
2020-12-18 02:18:20 <ais523> but, I think they used something proprietary to specify file types, not MIME
2020-12-18 02:18:25 <ais523> back when I last looked
2020-12-18 02:18:29 <ais523> maybe they're using MIME nowadays
2020-12-18 02:20:48 <ais523> oh wow, now I'm reading about CORB
2020-12-18 02:20:53 <ais523> and it is kind-of eso
2020-12-18 02:21:36 <ais523> the basic idea is that there are only a few types of thing that can be included into a web page via a cross-origin request, such as scripts and images
2020-12-18 02:22:18 <ais523> so if a web page tries to make a cross-origin request using <img> or <script> or whatever, but it starts with a character sequence that can't possibly start a valid image or script or the like, you stop reading so that the information doesn't end up in your process's memory
2020-12-18 02:23:12 <ais523> but the spec is so concerned about not breaking backwards compatibility that it starts getting worried about things ilke polyglots, and CSS files that start with closing brackets (apparently not banned by the spec even though it's useless_
2020-12-18 02:23:16 <ais523> s/_/)/
2020-12-18 02:24:31 <fizzie> I think we definitely set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff for the HackEso repo browsing.

2020-12-18 02:30:49 <ais523> I did a GET /logs/2020-12-18-raw.txt HTTP/1.1 over telnet
2020-12-18 02:31:09 <ais523> and the response contained Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8, but no X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
2020-12-18 02:31:13 <fizzie> I did a curl -I on it.
2020-12-18 02:31:24 <fizzie> Yeah, didn't think we did it on that, just the repo-browsing.
2020-12-18 02:31:27 <ais523> just Server, Date, Content-Type, Transfer-Encoding, and Connection
2020-12-18 02:31:43 <fizzie> Incidentally, those "raw" logs aren't actually the "native" raw logs, I just generate that format since it's the ad-hoc standard now.
2020-12-18 02:32:08 <ais523> they don't look nearly as HTMLish as the parsed logs
2020-12-18 02:32:19 <ais523> so I guess you'd have to spam a lot of HTML tags just after midnight in order to mount an attack
2020-12-18 02:33:08 <fizzie> It does start with a "tag" thanks to the <> direction indicators.
2020-12-18 02:33:17 <fizzie> Though a pretty weird tag.

2020-12-18 02:37:58 <ais523> and after reading through some more: apparently X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff isn't always respected because apparently Cloudflare sometimes adds it automatically in cases where the MIME type is actually wrong
2020-12-18 02:38:15 <ais523> so browsers are now having to second-guess the statement that the MIME type is correct‚Ä¶
2020-12-18 02:39:43 <ais523> one project I'm currently working on is a "safe" subset of HTML (the idea is that you specify an HTML page as a data structure, run it through the generator, and get some HTML that you know cannot be malicious because it was written in a subset that doesn't support any misusable features)
2020-12-18 02:40:10 <ais523> but I'm not sure if there's any way to even handle hyperlinks in something like this
2020-12-18 02:53:19 <b_jonas> "< ais523> one issue I've discovered with TCP is that in practice, you seem to need to duplicate a lot of TCP functionality to get reliable connections even when you're using TCP" => I think there was a proposal to solve that, with a middle-level protocol that looks sort of like TCP for the programs using it but does a bit more, especially being able to reestablish the connection if the client's IP
2020-12-18 02:53:25 <b_jonas> changes, aimed mostly for mobile phones.
2020-12-18 02:54:15 <fizzie> A friend of mine did some work/research on HIP back in the university days, I think.
2020-12-18 02:54:44 <fizzie> That's got a mobility thing in it.
2020-12-18 02:57:43 <b_jonas> "<fizzie> Incidentally, those "raw" logs aren't actually the "native" raw logs, I just generate that format since it's the ad-hoc standard now." => makes sense, given that you backfill logs when your log bot wasn't connected to the channel from other log sources
2020-12-18 02:58:57 <fizzie> There's that, too. Though one of those sources *is* the raw logs from codu, where I got that format from.
2020-12-18 02:59:37 <b_jonas> fizzie: I see. that only applies to before 2016, right?
2020-12-18 03:00:31 <fizzie> Yeah. The other source I have a backfill converter is just my personal logs.

2020-12-18 06:11:10 <int-e> b_jonas: The new semi-open state looks dangerous because it blocks off the 'close' path. However, we can only get into this situation by using the 'open' path without actually using the door... so if we end up in that situation, we can backtrack and bypass the 'open' pass completely.
2020-12-18 06:17:33 <shachaf> Oh no, I accidentally solved today's well-ordering theorem problem.
2020-12-18 06:17:42 <shachaf> People were talking about precedence parsers so I couldn't resist.
2020-12-18 06:18:12 <shachaf> But I don't have an account so I can't really confirm it.
2020-12-18 06:18:30 <int-e> So you didn't get to the great twist in part 2
2020-12-18 06:18:53 <shachaf> Is the twist that + is stickier than *?
2020-12-18 06:18:59 <int-e> Yes.
2020-12-18 06:19:01 <shachaf> Someone told it to me.
2020-12-18 06:19:08 <shachaf> It was a 2-character change in my parser.
2020-12-18 06:19:20 <shachaf> I mean, assuming it's correct, which I didn't test.
2020-12-18 06:19:58 <shachaf> Does it give the last test case the value 23340?
2020-12-18 06:20:41 <int-e> I skipped the description, wondered why my answer was wrong, then realized that if those were standard expressions, I should've fed them into something like bc instead, then read the problem properly...
2020-12-18 06:21:27 <int-e> And to top it off I messed up the change for part 2.
2020-12-18 06:21:38 <int-e> It wasn't a good performance today.
2020-12-18 06:22:17 <int-e> 23340 seems to be correct
2020-12-18 06:22:52 <int-e> I did not have any recent practice writing expression parsers.
2020-12-18 06:24:02 <shachaf> It's too bad almost everything people write about precedence parsers is way too complicated.
2020-12-18 06:24:08 <int-e> But the main failing was to assume too much rather than reading the damn specification.
2020-12-18 06:24:33 <shachaf> For example the Wikipedia example code has nested loops for no reason.
2020-12-18 06:26:01 <int-e> I decided to use parsec which annoyingly, makes left recursion hard. And while it has dedicated expression parser functionality that basically just takes a list of operators and their precedence and associativity, I didn't want to read up on that on the spot.
2020-12-18 06:26:50 <int-e> This stuff: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec-3.1.14.0/docs/Text-Parsec-Expr.html
2020-12-18 06:27:13 <shachaf> I wrote a C parser: https://slbkbs.org/tmp/pa.c

2020-12-18 06:45:50 <int-e> shachaf: well I'd habitually split the parse function up in one per precedence
2020-12-18 06:46:17 <shachaf> But this approach ("precedence climbing") is way better.
2020-12-18 06:47:07 <int-e> arguably

2020-12-18 12:58:07 <fizzie> I just wrote a regular handcrafted recursive-descent thing in Go, which (because of all the explicit `if err != nil { return nil, err }` business, which I guess in this context could've just been omitted) ended up annoyingly verbose.
2020-12-18 12:58:25 <fizzie> Also did read the description, but still managed to get part 2 the wrong way around first.

2020-12-18 14:26:09 <b_jonas> fungot, how do you spell Mississippi and how do you know your keyboard isn't broken when you do that?
2020-12-18 14:26:09 <fungot> b_jonas: mr president, i would like to thank you again for your support. i ask you, commissioner. we propose that this oral question.
2020-12-18 14:27:03 <int-e> how do you know your keyboard isn't broken?
2020-12-18 14:27:36 <int-e> there are keys on there that I hardly ever use
2020-12-18 14:28:31 <int-e> and that's just the tip of the iceberg. it could insert an extra 's' whenever I type 'lawlessnesss' and I'd probably never know :P
2020-12-18 14:29:28 <int-e> just imagine such a device, a keyboard that inserts plausible typos whenever a person starts typing quickly
2020-12-18 14:30:37 <fizzie> There are all these different lawlessnesses.

2020-12-18 22:01:50 <fizzie> Is there a concise name for that search where you have a function from the naturals, you know it has some property that's true (only) for all n >= N0, and you want to find out what N0 is, so you evaluate the function on 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ... until you have a pair where it's false for K but true for 2K, and then do a binary search in that range to find the exact value?
2020-12-18 22:01:55 <fizzie> It's not *just* a binary search, but it's not much more either.

2020-12-18 22:09:38 <zzo38> Do you have an example?

2020-12-18 22:13:59 <rain1> exponential search
2020-12-18 22:19:28 <fizzie> Apparently. Thanks.
2020-12-18 22:20:26 <shachaf> You can use any fast-growing function to find the upper bound presumably, there's no special reason for it to be doubling, right?
2020-12-18 22:21:04 <fizzie> Presumably. Though if you're going to use a binary search for the second part, it feels natural somehow.
2020-12-18 22:21:11 <fizzie> First you double, then you halve.
2020-12-18 22:23:52 <rain1> doubling is the best
2020-12-18 22:26:52 <fizzie> The Wikipedia article suggests as a variation a three-stage thing, where you start first by doubling the *exponent*, then do a binary search on the exponent to find the right interval, and then a binary search in the interval.
2020-12-18 22:27:05 <fizzie> (And the obvious generalization from that.)
2020-12-18 22:28:10 <b_jonas> there's always a function that you could use that grows faster than what you're using
2020-12-18 22:28:36 <rain1> is there always one that grows slower? fib grows slower than doubling
2020-12-18 22:28:39 <rain1> but what grows slower than fib?
2020-12-18 22:28:43 <shachaf> Presumably in many practical applications you just do know an upper bound, like 2^64.
2020-12-18 22:29:12 <shachaf> I guess you can call that "exponential search but starting with a high initial guess" to make it also theoretically complete.

2020-12-18 22:36:47 <shachaf> Or mayeb the argument is that the upper bound is often small, like 8, and you can save searches over log n by finding it sooner.
2020-12-18 22:43:15 <rain1> oh yes
2020-12-18 22:43:18 <rain1> log(n) tends to infinity
2020-12-18 22:43:21 <rain1> slowly
2020-12-18 22:57:27 <nakilon> fizzie maybe I misread but maybe it's a Newton method
2020-12-18 22:57:38 <nakilon> of finding where two lines intersect
2020-12-18 22:58:17 <nakilon> it splits in half, and it's basically that "guess the number" game
2020-12-18 23:00:31 <nakilon> or maybe I don't have a clue
2020-12-18 23:02:13 <rain1> that's true
2020-12-18 23:02:35 <rain1> it is the bisection method, but newton applied the derivative to make it faster

2020-12-18 23:11:49 <imode> looks like intel hex stuff.
2020-12-18 23:11:57 <imode> or gcode.
2020-12-18 23:14:28 <kmc> looks like a little bytecode for arduino?
2020-12-18 23:14:54 <b_jonas> hi Lykaina
2020-12-18 23:14:58 <Lykaina> hi
2020-12-18 23:16:30 <Lykaina> it doesn't require an external parser or a hex editor, unlike earlier attempts
2020-12-18 23:17:01 <imode> really?
2020-12-18 23:17:20 <kmc> I started playing with CircuitPython
2020-12-18 23:17:38 <Lykaina> what you see in the txt file is what is on the sd card
2020-12-18 23:17:48 <kmc> it's a neat concept, you can edit the .py file right on your embedded target (which appears as a mass storage device) and it runs the new code immediately
2020-12-18 23:17:52 <kmc> so there's no host-side dev tools needed
2020-12-18 23:18:20 <kmc> but the one circuitpython device I own does some kind of crazy things, it seems to try to be a keyboard and messes with my keyboard layout, among other issues
2020-12-18 23:18:23 <imode> so do you have an interpreter running on the arduino.
2020-12-18 23:18:31 <Lykaina> yes
2020-12-18 23:18:33 <imode> neat.
2020-12-18 23:18:44 <kmc> so I probably need to tweak the default firmware/script before I have some pleasing experience with CircuitPython
2020-12-18 23:18:48 * imode needs to get an ardunio so they have an AVR target.
2020-12-18 23:19:29 <Lykaina> 39 commands are recognized at the moment
2020-12-18 23:19:30 <imode> kmc: huh, this looks interesting... it doesn't run Python directly on the MCU, right?
2020-12-18 23:19:40 <imode> it just emits code for it.
2020-12-18 23:19:43 <kmc> no it does
2020-12-18 23:19:45 <imode> wat
2020-12-18 23:19:56 <imode> that's gotta be limiting.
2020-12-18 23:19:56 <kmc> they have some stripped down Python interpreter that runs on ARM Cortex-M and maybe some other CPUs
2020-12-18 23:19:59 <Lykaina> by the interpreter
2020-12-18 23:20:01 <kmc> not sure if there's any for AVR
2020-12-18 23:20:11 <kmc> yes, it is limiting
2020-12-18 23:20:11 <Lykaina> read the pdf
2020-12-18 23:20:13 <imode> ARM makes sense.
2020-12-18 23:21:10 <kmc> it's made to be a really easy way to get started with MCU programming

2020-12-18 23:21:22 <kmc> so in that respect I'm not the target audience, but i thought it'd be fun to play with anyway
2020-12-18 23:21:31 <imode> neat!
2020-12-18 23:22:32 <Lykaina> my echidna languages are pretty useless
2020-12-18 23:22:42 <kmc> Cortex-M MCUs are about as cheap as AVR these days
2020-12-18 23:22:53 <imode> I need an AVR target for Feather.
2020-12-18 23:23:54 <b_jonas> what
2020-12-18 23:24:43 <kmc> most of the embedded stuff i've done lately has been ESP8266
2020-12-18 23:24:53 <kmc> but it's quite limited on the hardware peripherals side
2020-12-18 23:24:58 <Lykaina> i'm a c programmer
2020-12-18 23:24:58 <kmc> I might get into ESP32
2020-12-18 23:25:08 <kmc> there's a new variant of ESP32 which has a RISC-V core
2020-12-18 23:25:13 <kmc> could probably run Rust on that
2020-12-18 23:25:14 <imode> that's nuts.
2020-12-18 23:25:33 <nakilon> there should be a brainfuck interpreter for arduino robot
2020-12-18 23:25:38 <Lykaina> is there a subset of c i could write an arduino interpreter for?
2020-12-18 23:25:47 <nakilon> that would go left and right on the line
2020-12-18 23:25:52 <kmc> nakilon: :D
2020-12-18 23:25:53 <kmc> i like it
2020-12-18 23:25:56 <imode> Lykaina: go further and write a forth.
2020-12-18 23:25:58 <nakilon> dropping stuff onto drawn cells on it
2020-12-18 23:26:06 <kmc> (the previous ESP's use Xtensa architecture which doesn't have a mature / working LLVM target)
2020-12-18 23:26:19 <Lykaina> i don't know forth
2020-12-18 23:26:27 <imode> you didn't know C either.
2020-12-18 23:26:44 <kmc> Lykaina: C isn't usually interpreted, but it's not to say nobody's ever written an interpreter for it
2020-12-18 23:26:56 <kmc> from a quick search https://github.com/jpoirier/picoc might be of interest
2020-12-18 23:27:04 <nakilon> if you make arduino robot turn in place you can make a befunge interpreter
2020-12-18 23:27:07 <nakilon> or at least rasel
2020-12-18 23:27:22 <nakilon> need a camera reading the cells from the ground
2020-12-18 23:27:38 <kmc> for that matter you could probably fit a minimal C *compiler* and dynamic loader on AVR
2020-12-18 23:27:45 <kmc> I men, it was originally developed for PDP-11
2020-12-18 23:27:58 <imode> people often forget that.
2020-12-18 23:28:03 <imode> for better or worse.
2020-12-18 23:29:21 <imode> also re: brainfuck, I implemented a BF DSL in my language. line 365 and 374. https://hastebin.com/kehapukuxa.txt
2020-12-18 23:29:23 <kmc> one issue, AVR is a Harvard architecture, you can't execute code directly from RAM
2020-12-18 23:29:37 <kmc> but there are special instructions you can use to write to flash
2020-12-18 23:29:48 <kmc> which are used for example by the Arduino bootloader
