2020-12-18 01:29:09 <LegionMammal978> E.g., if I enter a V going right, do I exit the + in the parent program going right or going up?

2020-12-18 01:50:21 <ais523> shachaf: zzo38: there is apparently an unofficial standard for gopher over TLS
2020-12-18 01:50:33 Joined: Lord_of_Life
2020-12-18 01:50:45 <ais523> it is very simple, too: you just make a TLS connection on port 70
2020-12-18 01:51:07 <ais523> (a gophers server distinguishes between gopher-over-TLS and regular gopher by checking to see whether the first thing the client sends is a TLS handshake)
2020-12-18 01:51:10 Quit: Lord_of_Life (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
2020-12-18 01:51:53 <shachaf> What's the thing with TLS where the server must identify all the domain names it possibly knows about and then the client checks whether it matches?
2020-12-18 01:51:54 Nick Change: Lord_of_Life -> Lord_of_Life
2020-12-18 01:52:02 <shachaf> Rather than the cient saying what domain name it thinks it's accessing.
2020-12-18 01:52:08 <shachaf> Seems bizarre to me.
2020-12-18 01:52:43 <ais523> sounds like one of the many variants of SNI
2020-12-18 01:52:53 <shachaf> TCP is presumably just a dead end if you want efficient networking protocols.
2020-12-18 01:53:04 <ais523> the basic problem is that in most TLS connections, the server name indication is sent in the clear, so anyone listening in knows what site you're connecting
2020-12-18 01:53:10 <ais523> and there have been various proposals to remedy that
2020-12-18 01:53:33 <shachaf> With TLS being one of the reasons.
2020-12-18 01:53:48 <shachaf> Hmm, I see, so eavesdroppers know whether I'm connecting to youtube.com vs. google.com or something.
2020-12-18 01:53:59 <ais523> the basic problem is that it's hard to deploy anything like this at a small scale, because with a small hosting company, you can normally figure out which site is being connected to simply from the IP
2020-12-18 01:54:09 <shachaf> I guess you might want to keep that information secret, especially with DNS becoming encrypted these days.
2020-12-18 01:54:20 <ais523> so in order to really keep it private, you need a wide range of different sites that are all hosted from the same IP so people aren't sure which is which
2020-12-18 01:54:43 <ais523> Cloudflare apparently added some sort of encrypted SNI recently, because they have the right sort of infrastructure for that
2020-12-18 01:55:42 <ais523> I'm a little surprised that gopher is still being developed nowadays (at least, within the last couple of years)
2020-12-18 01:56:01 <ais523> but apparently some people like it due to the lack of things like JavaScript-based adverts because the protocol can't handle them
2020-12-18 01:56:41 <shachaf> Gophers are OK but kitty cats are where it's at, if you ask me.
2020-12-18 01:57:11 <zzo38> I think that the web browser is the wrong place to implement encrypted DNS, since DNS is something that you will want many programs to use, not only the web browser.
2020-12-18 01:57:15 <ais523> well, cat has even fewer features than gopher
2020-12-18 01:57:50 <shachaf> Is QUIC a good alternative to TCP?
2020-12-18 01:59:23 <ais523> one issue I've discovered with TCP is that in practice, you seem to need to duplicate a lot of TCP functionality to get reliable connections even when you're using TCP
2020-12-18 01:59:33 <ais523> in real life, TCP connections have a tendency to break for no reason
2020-12-18 01:59:37 <ais523> this somehow even happens on localhost
