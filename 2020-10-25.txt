2020-10-25 00:04:33 <arseniiv> Snakebird looks like it would make a good esolang, as birds can grow any length, they can stuck and they have great hysteresis, and also one can blow a sleeping bird graphic marker to mean something more
2020-10-25 00:06:19 <arseniiv> e. g. imagine a nondeterministic machine where birds move in all possible ways to reach a goal or to go through kind of checkpoints
2020-10-25 00:07:56 <arseniiv> one can encode data in a bird’s form like how many squares does it run between turns
2020-10-25 00:10:27 <arseniiv> hm this scheme makes addition on ℕ easy: you have a L-shaped bird and you just need it to straighten at the portal
2020-10-25 00:14:11 <arseniiv> now we need to specify how the bird is placed at the start, e. g. if it’s the tail square that’s fixed in place or the head square, and which orientation the bird is, and also I now see that we can’t add unbounded numbers if we place the snake and the portal both in predetermined places
2020-10-25 00:17:48 <arseniiv> that’s not all that obvious so maybe I’m wrong
