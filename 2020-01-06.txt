2020-01-06 00:00:09 <b_jonas> it's a "new" thing, in the sense that it became used during the time I've been using linux
2020-01-06 00:01:17 <b_jonas> earlier we only had ordinary file systems backed on ramdisks, which are like flat virtual devices that are stored in the (virtual) memory, swappable, but then the kernel has to do most of the work that it would have to do to represent the file system on a (very fast) flat block device
2020-01-06 00:01:18 <zzo38> Specifically the data I want the external program to read is a blob in a SQLite database; maybe I should have mentioned that at first.
2020-01-06 00:01:29 <b_jonas> so tmpfs is more efficient
2020-01-06 00:01:49 <b_jonas> DOS also supports ramdisk
2020-01-06 00:02:38 <b_jonas> zzo38: but what does the program that you spawn do with its input and output?
2020-01-06 00:03:01 <zzo38> Converts it into a different format.
2020-01-06 00:03:33 <b_jonas> are the input and output very large? do you need interactivity, that is, do you want to get part of the output while you're still streaming the input?
2020-01-06 00:03:42 <b_jonas> and what do you do with the output?
2020-01-06 00:03:51 <zzo38> (And actually it isn't the entire blob; a few bytes at the beginning will be skipped, and this number may vary.)
2020-01-06 00:04:51 <zzo38> The input and output are potentially large, because it is a picture of the art in a card (e.g. the art box in a Magic: the Gathering card).
2020-01-06 00:04:55 <b_jonas> also is the sql database in a file that is slow to read, and do you want to be able to stop reading early in case of an error?
2020-01-06 00:05:16 <b_jonas> zzo38: just small vs large doesn't matter (unless it's so small that you just pass it in the argv), I'm asking if it can be very large
2020-01-06 00:05:36 <b_jonas> so it's not too large
2020-01-06 00:05:37 <zzo38> It might be very large if you are printing at a high resolution.
2020-01-06 00:06:19 <zzo38> The SQL database is already open by the main program (TeXnicard; maybe telling it is TeXnicard is also useful to you I don't know)
2020-01-06 00:07:17 <b_jonas> I'd probably just write the input data to a temporary regular file on a fast file system. if you can conveniently pass file descriptors to the program that you spawn, then unlink the file and pass just a file descriptor, that way if something goes wrong it's less likely that you have the temp file file remain on the disk.
2020-01-06 00:08:16 <b_jonas> you usually don't even need an actual tmpfs, if you don't have security requirements, because if everything fits in memory and you delete the file soon then the file won't leave the cache, and if it doesn't fit in memory then writing it out to the disk is a feature,
2020-01-06 00:08:48 <b_jonas> but if you have a fast swap device and no readily accessible file system on the fast device and no file system cache on the fast device, then you may want a tmpfs anyway
2020-01-06 00:08:55 <b_jonas> but that's not a common configuration these days
2020-01-06 00:09:56 <b_jonas> linux can now even handle the case when you store the file system on a slower rotating disk but cache it on a large SSD, because this is getting a commonly useful case
2020-01-06 00:10:10 <b_jonas> you have to configure it well, and I don't know the details, but I hear it's working well
2020-01-06 00:10:19 <zzo38> I didn't know it has that, but I thought of that too.
2020-01-06 00:10:52 <b_jonas> that need not be true if you're using old operating system software though, but then you likely won't have a fast SSD

2020-01-06 00:11:36 <b_jonas> I don't really know what happens on Windows, I deliberately avoid all system administration responsibilities for Windows and don't want to learn more than I really need for my job
2020-01-06 00:11:57 <b_jonas> i.e. I don't work in system administration, but I need to administer my work desktop a bit to just use it for work
2020-01-06 00:12:31 <zzo38> I could write the data from the database to an external file and then pass that to the external program and then read back the output into memory, I suppose, since the output is likely to be larger than the input, but then that requires making a copy of the data
2020-01-06 00:12:53 <b_jonas> what will you do with the output?
2020-01-06 00:12:59 <b_jonas> will you send it to a printer?
2020-01-06 00:13:19 <b_jonas> or show it on the screen?
2020-01-06 00:15:14 <zzo38> It will be combined with an in-memory picture
2020-01-06 00:15:24 <b_jonas> I think this case hasn't come up for me, because I always just had the compressed image or video data stored in a disk file, and the raw data in memory going through a pipe
2020-01-06 00:16:37 <b_jonas> in one case the uncompressed data was also in a disk file, but in a format that I had to decode in my program (not sqlite specifically), but even then the other side, the compressed data went to disk files
2020-01-06 00:20:18 <zzo38> In my case the compressed data is in a SQLite database rather than a file by itself, and there should not be any need to store the uncompressed data in any file. The blob starts with a flag byte and then the MIME type (omitting "image/" if it belongs to that category, otherwise the full MIME type) and then the data in the format specified by the MIME type, and the configuration file specifies how to decode it.
2020-01-06 00:21:08 <b_jonas> and I presume the same database contains other metadata over just the images
2020-01-06 00:21:19 <b_jonas> which is why you don't just store the compressed image in a separate file
2020-01-06 00:23:24 <zzo38> Yes, that is true.
2020-01-06 00:23:56 <zzo38> And that is why it isn't stored in a separate file.
2020-01-06 00:30:14 <b_jonas> zzo38: if you want to eg. send the uncompressed data to the printer, you can consider trying to not send that data through your process, so that your process only send ths compressed image to the forked process, and then the convereted output from that process is sent to whatever program does the printing
2020-01-06 00:31:56 <b_jonas> then you don't need any non-blocking things
2020-01-06 00:32:10 <b_jonas> but it's also not too hard to handle the two pipes in a select loop if you really need to
2020-01-06 00:32:33 <zzo38> That picture is not the entire card, though, but only a part of it. And there is no guarantee that there will not be other stuff overlapping, or other things done to it before the page is completed.
2020-01-06 00:33:21 <zzo38> (This program is meant to render cards for card games such as Magic: the Gathering; like MSE but different.)
2020-01-06 00:33:47 <b_jonas> zzo38: and you want to process that uncompressed data together with some other data you read from the database, which is why you want it in the same process?
2020-01-06 00:33:56 <zzo38> Yes.
2020-01-06 00:34:43 <b_jonas> well, then either write something to a temporary file (that you unlink when you no longer need), or use a select loop to read and write the pipe in an unknown order
2020-01-06 00:35:05 <b_jonas> if you need both sides from the same process then that's mostly what you can do
2020-01-06 00:35:42 <b_jonas> though for some converters, you may be sure that it won't start writing even a header before it completely reads its input, in which case you can just write the input to the pipe and then read the output, without select or nonblocking
2020-01-06 00:35:59 <b_jonas> that can depend on the converter and its options
2020-01-06 00:36:05 <zzo38> Yes, OK. Probably I will just copy the data from the database to a temporary file when doing it, I suppose; that seems to be easily enough.
2020-01-06 00:36:25 <zzo38> Yes, about what you said about the converter is true, but such thing is not known by this program
2020-01-06 00:37:18 <b_jonas> of course another possibility is to also put the converter in the same process
2020-01-06 00:37:30 <b_jonas> which I could do with ImageMagick in particualr
2020-01-06 00:37:51 <b_jonas> because it has some dynamic libraries and documented interfaces
2020-01-06 00:37:57 <b_jonas> C and C++ interfaces
2020-01-06 00:38:30 <b_jonas> I think those allow reading compressed image streams from in memory, though I haven't actually tried that
2020-01-06 00:38:46 <zzo38> Yes, although I am not even knowing if it is a format supported by ImageMagick or not, for one thing.
2020-01-06 00:39:08 <b_jonas> even for embedding, I read/wrote the compressed image from/to disk files, I just manipulated the uncompressed image data in memory of the same process
2020-01-06 00:39:39 <zzo38> (I can easily change how it communicates with the external program later if needed, I suppose.)
2020-01-06 00:40:41 <b_jonas> sure, but you can do this with some libraries other than ImageMagick too
2020-01-06 00:41:23 <b_jonas> there are good reasons for that, beacuse ImageMagick doesn't natively support everything
2020-01-06 00:42:57 <zzo38> The way I have though, the user can install only the ones they need, rather than needing to add all of the dependencies that you don't use
2020-01-06 00:42:59 <b_jonas> though you can also do conversion to a more convenient image format when you're importing to the database, and later read that convenient (but still compressed) input format with ImageMagick
2020-01-06 00:44:19 <b_jonas> this can happen if you scan or photograph the card, but then preprocess the image and store the cleaned up image in the database as a jpeg
2020-01-06 00:46:32 <b_jonas> that's when you can also rotate and crop and color correct the scan/photo, not just convert formats
2020-01-06 00:46:40 <zzo38> Yes, I suppose that can also work, although then I wouldn't need to support more than one format inside the process (since conversion from any other format can be done before importing into the database), but JPEG is probably not a good choice in this case because JPEG is lossy.
2020-01-06 00:47:29 <zzo38> (Also, the picture is not necessarily RGB and it might be CMYK instead.)
2020-01-06 00:47:35 <b_jonas> you can still have more than one formats, since ImageMagick handles multiple formats with a natively built in decoder
2020-01-06 00:48:00 <b_jonas> ImageMagick abstracts away some of those format differences
2020-01-06 00:49:27 <zzo38> Probably only the artwork of the card would be stored in the database; the border pictures would be in external files.
2020-01-06 00:49:33 <b_jonas> sure
2020-01-06 00:49:48 <b_jonas> that doesn't change much of what I said
2020-01-06 00:50:05 <b_jonas> mind you, these days there are too many cards with art extending outside the borders that you might not want to do that
2020-01-06 00:50:19 <b_jonas> for the inner and middle borders that is
2020-01-06 00:50:37 <b_jonas> you can do it with the outer black (or white) border, except for Un-sets
2020-01-06 00:51:38 <b_jonas> but if you're assembling your own cards from art that you have, then you might store different elements of the card separately
2020-01-06 00:51:38 <zzo38> Whether or not the art extends outside of the border wouldn't be built into the program anyways, since that stuff can be controlled by templates.
2020-01-06 00:52:03 <zzo38> Have you used Magic Set Editor?
2020-01-06 00:52:22 <b_jonas> one image for the art box, one image for the inner and middle border and text box, one for the text box watermark, and some for mana symbols
2020-01-06 00:52:26 <b_jonas> no, I haven't used it
2020-01-06 00:53:12 <b_jonas> I haven't created physical custom Magic cards, except simple proxies by putting a handwritten slip of paper next to the card inside the sleeve
2020-01-06 00:54:40 <zzo38> Different elements of the card would be stored separately, some stuff (specific to these individual cards and the set) in the database, and other stuff (applicable to any cards) in the template.
2020-01-06 00:57:36 <zzo38> If you are interested in TeXnicard then you should probably join the newsgroups of it. Also, for mana symbols I would probably want to use fonts instead (MSE uses pictures for the mana symbols, but I think to use fonts for the mana symbols will be better).
2020-01-06 00:58:23 <b_jonas> sure, if you have a font that contains all forty-something mana symbols, then that can work
2020-01-06 00:58:43 <b_jonas> plus the tap and untap symbol

2020-01-06 01:32:27 <Lykaina> do we discuss magic the gathering in here?

2020-01-06 01:36:04 <zzo38> This channel isn't mainly for Magic: the Gathering, but sometimes we will discuss anything including Magic: the Gathering if there isn't the esoteric programming to discuss at the time, I suppose.

2020-01-06 04:02:03 <imode> if you build a tool, and it has no purpose, what's the point of the tool?
2020-01-06 04:03:35 <zzo38> I don't know.
2020-01-06 04:06:09 <\oren\> should I rewrite my font editor in Rust?
2020-01-06 04:08:18 <imode> what's the purpose?
2020-01-06 04:37:42 <\oren\> it has a memory leak and I can't find it
2020-01-06 04:38:05 <\oren\> if I rewrite it in rust, that is supposed to mean it can't have memory leaks
2020-01-06 04:38:11 <zzo38> What font formats does it use?
2020-01-06 04:38:15 <\oren\> CDF
2020-01-06 04:38:19 <\oren\> BDF
2020-01-06 04:38:28 <zzo38> OK
2020-01-06 04:38:35 <zzo38> What is it written in now?
2020-01-06 04:38:37 <\oren\> C
2020-01-06 04:38:49 <zzo38> OK. Did you publish it?
2020-01-06 04:44:00 <zzo38> I have read of use of farbfeld compressed with bzip2 for picture compression. However, if a picture is in JPEG format then it seem JPEG is a better compression, but farbfeld compressed with bzip2 will be a better compression than PNG in some cases.

2020-01-06 04:56:02 <zzo38> What transformations can be done to improve JPEG compression without being more lossy?
2020-01-06 04:56:17 <zzo38> (Assuming the file that you are trying to transform is already JPEG)
2020-01-06 05:09:37 <imode> \oren\: valgrind?
2020-01-06 05:10:15 <imode> how do I build this?
2020-01-06 05:11:21 <imode> and do you have a sample file?
2020-01-06 05:11:40 <imode> built it, now I need a sample file.
2020-01-06 05:16:50 <\oren\> http://www.orenwatson.be/neoletters.bdf
2020-01-06 05:17:39 <zzo38> You could also try pcf2bdf
2020-01-06 05:18:38 <\oren\> oh and it also need s UnicodeData.txt from the unicode foundation
2020-01-06 05:18:53 <imode> mind linking me that?
2020-01-06 05:19:18 <imode> nvm.
2020-01-06 05:19:36 <\oren\> (this is how it displays the names) https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/UnicodeData.txt
2020-01-06 05:19:58 <imode> interesting..
2020-01-06 05:20:04 <imode> how do I exit the editor?
2020-01-06 05:20:12 <\oren\> ctrl-Q
2020-01-06 05:20:24 <\oren\> or ctrl-X to exit without saving
2020-01-06 05:21:32 <imode> interesting, yeah that's quite the memory leak. let's see if you clean up your allocated space.
2020-01-06 05:21:46 <zzo38> What if you want to make a non-Unicode font though? Then the Unicode data is not applicable.
2020-01-06 05:21:55 <imode> it looks like you never clean up the file judging by the size of the leak. the input BDF was ~3mb.
2020-01-06 05:22:02 <\oren\> oh
2020-01-06 05:22:05 <\oren\> hmmm
2020-01-06 05:22:43 <imode> 4,347,372 bytes allocated and in-use at exit, but no double frees.
2020-01-06 05:23:15 <\oren\> ok I'
2020-01-06 05:23:30 <\oren\> fix that and then see if it still has a leak
2020-01-06 05:24:24 <imode> I'm not that far in but I don't see any buffer cleanup, yeah.
2020-01-06 05:26:26 <imode> when you load the font, you `malloc` quite a bit of stuff and attach it to the passed-in bdfinfo, but I don't see you freeing it.
2020-01-06 05:26:42 <\oren\> I guess I kinda forgot that valgrind can't tell the difference between things still accessable at exit and things that have "actually" leaked
2020-01-06 05:26:45 <imode> that plus a calloc and no free.
2020-01-06 05:27:04 <imode> yeah you haven't lost the references to anything, you just haven't cleaned up the stuff you have references to.
2020-01-06 05:27:44 <imode> you `calloc` a big ol' hunk of space for some glyphs but you never free them.
2020-01-06 05:29:48 <imode> this is if you just load a font file, save and close. I imagine if you open another, you'll do the same allocations and lose the previous references.
2020-01-06 05:29:57 <zzo38> I think valgrind can tell you which one is "lost", though.
2020-01-06 05:30:27 <imode> it can and will.
2020-01-06 05:30:55 <\oren\> yeah apparently I'm bad at know what valgrind is saying
2020-01-06 05:33:01 <\oren\> I thought it meant I actually lost reference to that much
2020-01-06 05:33:11 <imode> nah, just means it's in use at exit.
2020-01-06 05:33:22 <imode> you'll see that with SDL and a couple of other libs.
2020-01-06 05:36:32 <\oren\> I'm going to work on making these tools more flexible and possible to work on fonts with different dimensions
2020-01-06 05:37:06 <imode> I dig the editing aesthetic. a lot of the glyphs are broken for me though.
2020-01-06 05:37:52 <\oren\> Well it relies on my fon't particular method of displaying braille to look good
2020-01-06 05:38:02 <imode> oh no the braile works great.
2020-01-06 05:38:17 <imode> this is garbage on my screen, though: "ùîÖùîáùîâùïñùïïùïöùï•"
2020-01-06 05:38:42 <imode> too compressed I guess.
2020-01-06 05:41:56 <\oren\> https://imgur.com/GKQKGJG
2020-01-06 05:42:37 <imode> ah yeah, I can kinda see the edit part. capitals are just totally gone, though. my terminal is trying lmao.
2020-01-06 05:42:38 <\oren\> it says BDF in fraktur and edit in blackboard bold
2020-01-06 05:43:42 <\oren\> In my font, bold fraktur I gave up on and I made it uncial instead
2020-01-06 05:43:50 <imode> looks solid on that screen.
2020-01-06 05:45:45 <\oren\> https://imgur.com/yCgc3Kv I like how the unicode consortium added all these but then was like, full superscript and subscript alphabets? that's too far
2020-01-06 05:46:23 <imode> unicode doesn't have those? wtf.
2020-01-06 05:47:49 <\oren\> superscript small q, large C, Q, S, X, Y, Z are all that is missing for superscript
2020-01-06 05:48:29 <zzo38> I made up a better character set for the specific use of being used on a fix pitch text grid, such as on a terminal emulator.

2020-01-06 05:49:24 <\oren\> there was a big argument on the Unicode mailing list about it
2020-01-06 05:49:47 <\oren\> and basically the rasoning was, unicode isn't supposed to be used for formatting
2020-01-06 05:49:54 <imode> bullshit.
2020-01-06 05:50:01 <imode> that reasoning is bullshit.
2020-01-06 05:50:02 <\oren\> it is bullshit
2020-01-06 05:50:22 <imode> isn't there a character reversal glyph.
2020-01-06 05:50:41 <imode> U+202E?
2020-01-06 05:50:43 <zzo38> Unicode is very messy, and is equally bad for all uses.
2020-01-06 05:51:42 <zzo38> However, it does have the advantage of being compatible with ASCII, at least.
2020-01-06 05:51:46 <imode> yeah, bullshit, there's many, many, _many_ cases where unicode makes explicit statements about how a thing should be formatted. if that was a disagreement, the super and subscript forms shouldn't even be included, not this half measure.
2020-01-06 05:54:23 <zzo38> Do you like my terminal character coding? (It is not meant to be used for other purposes, though; but there may be other character sets useful for the other purposes.)
2020-01-06 05:54:38 <imode> I don't know your terminal character coding.

2020-01-06 06:00:03 <\oren\> yeah width is really messy in unicode and one of the goals of my font is to be the only large font that actually has correct width as defined in Unicode Standard Annex #11 East Asian Width
2020-01-06 06:00:56 <\oren\> becuase no other font maker seems to care, and in particular, GNU unifont has wide devanagari which is stupid
2020-01-06 06:01:45 <\oren\> GNU unifont totally ignores the fact that nearly all terminals use the annex #11 for width data
2020-01-06 06:03:02 <zzo38> I think what I did is better though.

2020-01-06 06:06:04 <\oren\> the main goal of my font is to display unicode correctly and more-or-less biguously in a terminal
2020-01-06 06:06:49 <zzo38> O, OK. Well, then you have it good for that. But I think that Unicode is the wrong character set for this purpose.
2020-01-06 06:07:19 <zzo38> Also, the word "biguously" is not in Wiktionary (nor is "biguous").
2020-01-06 06:10:36 <\oren\> I use biguous because unambiguous seems like a double negative

2020-01-06 07:11:28 <zzo38> Ghostscript includes a file viewjpeg.ps to print a JPEG file. In the comments where it says the author's address, I found a quine in PostScript.
2020-01-06 07:14:06 <zzo38> (Also, it doesn't take the JPEG file name as a command line argument, even though Ghostscripts supports that. It is easily enough to fix it so that it does, though.)

2020-01-06 10:45:34 <wib_jonas> Lykaina: sometimes this channel talk about esoteric aspects of Magic: the Gathering. In particular, ais523 presented two attempts at proving M:tG Turing complete, in the sense that you can transform any computation to a game that terminates iff the computation terminates.

2020-01-06 10:47:36 <wib_jonas> See https://esolangs.org/wiki/Talk:StackFlow , there's one attempt to proof based on the StackFlow language, which has a bug that we couldn't fix;
2020-01-06 10:48:07 <wib_jonas> then there's a later attempt of proof based on a simpler computation model, The Waterfall Model, where the problem hinges on compiling universal computation to a small enough Waterfall Model program
2020-01-06 10:51:02 <wib_jonas> This latter one is believed to prove at least Turing completeness, and ais523 details it in an article linked from there.
2020-01-06 10:52:00 <wib_jonas> I wonder if you can get more than Turing completeness if you take the rules for breaking infinite loops literally.
2020-01-06 10:55:11 <int-e> wtf. '721.1a The rules for taking shortcuts are largely informal. As long as each player in the game understands the intent of each other player, any shortcut system they use is acceptable.'
2020-01-06 10:56:00 <int-e> That gives you a lot of leeway when it comes to TC-ness... by choosing sufficiently well-informed players.
2020-01-06 10:57:10 <int-e> Oh. 712.1c says tournaments are different :/
2020-01-06 10:57:27 <wib_jonas> Actually the article is based on a different construction

2020-01-06 11:04:22 <int-e> The tournament version of shortcuts is sufficiently fun.

2020-01-06 11:48:25 <kspalaiologos> because I've got a nice one
2020-01-06 11:48:35 <kspalaiologos> that requires more gigabytes of memory than there are atoms in universe
2020-01-06 11:48:45 <kspalaiologos> and I *know* it will finish, eventually
2020-01-06 11:49:15 <Taneb> How many states?
2020-01-06 11:51:16 <kspalaiologos> it's hard to tell
2020-01-06 11:51:29 <kspalaiologos> really
2020-01-06 11:51:37 <kspalaiologos> the program is around 40MB big
2020-01-06 11:52:09 <Taneb> Then that's not very interesting

2020-01-06 12:17:57 <int-e> http://www.logique.jussieu.fr/~michel/bbc.html has some pertinent numbers
2020-01-06 12:22:27 <Taneb> It looks like you can require more memory than there are atms in the universe with 2 symbols and 7 states
2020-01-06 12:25:06 <int-e> Or 6 states, unless you compress the tape (assuming the tape is compressible... which seems likely since we do have a termination proof)
2020-01-06 12:27:26 <int-e> (going by the 10^78 to 10^82 estimate for the number of atoms in the universe, with a very generous margin for error.)
2020-01-06 12:29:47 <int-e> Of course the tape is very compressible if you accept a description of the form "tape after executing the TM M for n steps, starting from an empty tape".

2020-01-06 13:27:09 <kspalaiologos> OO
2020-01-06 13:27:12 <kspalaiologos> who would like OO
2020-01-06 13:27:24 <kspalaiologos> all you need is procedural programming
2020-01-06 13:27:40 <int-e> OO gives you associated namespaces for your types.
2020-01-06 13:27:43 <int-e> I like that.
2020-01-06 13:27:54 <kspalaiologos> the main principle of OO is encapsulation
2020-01-06 13:28:13 <kspalaiologos> so you don't have a global state, but rather it's simplified down to object instances

2020-01-06 13:28:43 <int-e> ("OO gives you namespaces for types" of course is the one benefit that you lose instantly when encoding it in C)
2020-01-06 13:29:07 <kspalaiologos> if two objects instances mutate (send a message) to certain single object, you lose the benefit of encapsulation
2020-01-06 13:29:21 <kspalaiologos> and there is something that resembles the state
2020-01-06 13:29:32 <kspalaiologos> Namespace for types?
2020-01-06 13:29:39 <int-e> I really liked OO for MUD programming.
2020-01-06 13:30:04 <kspalaiologos> alright?
2020-01-06 13:30:18 <kspalaiologos> I thought about extending C a bit
2020-01-06 13:30:20 <int-e> So you have monsters as objects, players as objects, things you carry around as objects, rooms as objects... it's mostly very tangible.
2020-01-06 13:30:27 <kspalaiologos> yeah
2020-01-06 13:30:34 <kspalaiologos> but you could do this in C
2020-01-06 13:30:43 <kspalaiologos> look at linux source code and how the drivers are implemented
2020-01-06 13:30:51 <int-e> "you can do this in C" is not a valid argument
2020-01-06 13:31:19 <kspalaiologos> it would be as comfortable when done procedurally as the example you're giving
2020-01-06 13:31:36 <int-e> It's basically a tautology. (You can program it in C, or you can't program it at all.)
2020-01-06 13:33:22 <int-e> I'm quite happy with the fragment of C++ that has structs and classes, no inheritance, and a small amount of templates. I prefer it to doing the same thing in C because of the namespace thing, and well, because templates offer some amount of code generation when you need it.
2020-01-06 13:34:12 <int-e> (Oh and exceptions see the occasional use as well... as non-local returns.)
2020-01-06 13:44:14 <wib_jonas> int-e: yes, but with or without implicitly called user-defined destructors (and implicitly called copy/move constructors/initializers)? because that is, I think, what most clearly distinguishes C++ from C.
2020-01-06 13:45:39 <kspalaiologos> one could employ boehm GC
2020-01-06 13:45:41 <int-e> wib_jonas: I really try to stick to pod-types.
2020-01-06 13:45:46 <kspalaiologos> all your low level stuff is gone
2020-01-06 13:51:35 <int-e> kspalaiologos: I do use Haskell too. :P
2020-01-06 13:52:02 <kspalaiologos> any ideas on brainfuck <=> SQLite interop?
2020-01-06 13:52:10 <kspalaiologos> especially the callbacks
2020-01-06 13:52:12 <kspalaiologos> how to get over 'em
2020-01-06 13:52:55 <int-e> I'll go out on a limb and say I have better things to think about.
2020-01-06 13:53:32 <kspalaiologos> it's already an amazing thing to think about
2020-01-06 13:53:45 <kspalaiologos> also, as you use haskell you're probably experienced in CS theory
2020-01-06 13:54:03 <kspalaiologos> would you tell me how the f*ck can 3-celled brainfuck be Turing complete
2020-01-06 13:54:07 <int-e> I mean I admire your efforts to deprive "Brainfuck" of its esolang status, but I don't want to be part of it.
2020-01-06 13:54:16 <kspalaiologos> I know about collatz function
2020-01-06 13:54:21 <kspalaiologos> and I know it proves turing completness
2020-01-06 13:54:34 <kspalaiologos> but it makes no sense to me that you can for example do modulus operation on it
2020-01-06 13:54:35 <fizzie> There was that one brainfuck system call library thingamajick, what was it called? Wasn't really anything very surprising, though -- just a specific protocol for the input/output instructions.

2020-01-06 13:54:43 <int-e> kspalaiologos: Just work through oerjan's construction.
2020-01-06 13:54:56 <int-e> It's only slightly tricky!!!1
2020-01-06 13:55:07 <kspalaiologos> kritixilithos, wiring up SQLite to write an URL shortener in brainfuck
2020-01-06 13:55:19 <kspalaiologos> int-e, I mean, possibly
2020-01-06 13:55:21 <kritixilithos> what have you added so far?
2020-01-06 13:55:33 <kspalaiologos> interop between brainfuck and sqlite
2020-01-06 13:55:41 <kspalaiologos> currently you can just INSERT to the database
2020-01-06 13:55:50 <kspalaiologos> SELECT is being worked on because I can't get over the callback mechanism
2020-01-06 13:56:32 <kspalaiologos> I thought that if I had 3 bignum cells and a brainfuck like language
2020-01-06 13:56:40 <kspalaiologos> to prove it's turing complete I'd simulate a stack machine
2020-01-06 13:56:47 <kspalaiologos> that has two stacks and in result is turing complete
2020-01-06 13:56:52 <kspalaiologos> so the proof is more practical
2020-01-06 13:57:20 <kspalaiologos> to push something on a stack I'd just *= 255 & += n;
2020-01-06 13:57:28 <kspalaiologos> but to pop something out of the stack I need modulus
2020-01-06 13:57:40 <fizzie> There was https://esolangs.org/wiki/Systemf but that's not the one I was thinking of, it was more abstract and didn't introduce any new commands.
2020-01-06 13:57:59 <kspalaiologos> there was ESOAPI for ESOOS
2020-01-06 13:58:04 <kspalaiologos> but it's garbage for userland programming
2020-01-06 13:58:12 <kspalaiologos> that used something along ANSI escapes but better
2020-01-06 13:58:37 <int-e> kspalaiologos: pushing isn't the problem... popping is.
2020-01-06 13:58:41 <fizzie> Right, and https://esolangs.org/wiki/PESOIX
2020-01-06 13:58:42 <kspalaiologos> sure
2020-01-06 13:58:52 <kspalaiologos> thats what I just said
2020-01-06 13:58:52 <int-e> You'd need a division by a constant with remainder using only two cells.
2020-01-06 13:58:57 <kspalaiologos> yes
2020-01-06 13:59:07 <int-e> The fun thing about Collatz machines is that you get 3 cells for that task, effectively.
2020-01-06 13:59:17 <int-e> s/machines/functions/
2020-01-06 13:59:49 <kspalaiologos> but it would be possible to translate 3-cell brainfuck to 2-register MM
2020-01-06 14:00:04 <int-e> Not necessarily.
2020-01-06 14:00:10 <kspalaiologos> why
2020-01-06 14:00:25 <kspalaiologos> 2-register MM is turing complete
2020-01-06 14:00:33 <kspalaiologos> it should be able to simulate any turing machine
2020-01-06 14:00:43 <int-e> Fair enough.
2020-01-06 14:00:55 <int-e> However then it won't be complexity preserving.
2020-01-06 14:01:01 <kspalaiologos> yeah
2020-01-06 14:01:08 <kspalaiologos> and the translation process may never finish
2020-01-06 14:01:20 <int-e> A direcy, complexity preserving translation will almost certainly need 3 cells.
2020-01-06 14:01:24 <int-e> *direct
2020-01-06 14:01:26 <int-e> s/cells/counters/
2020-01-06 14:01:33 <kspalaiologos> or yeah
2020-01-06 14:01:46 <kspalaiologos> nut the thing that bothers me the most in this case are unbalanced loops
2020-01-06 14:02:17 <kspalaiologos> because one can't refer to variable register using MM
2020-01-06 14:02:28 <int-e> Because a 3-cell Brainfuck program can divide a counter that is known to be even by 2 in two cells, while keeping another counter around. A Minsky machine cannot divide a counter in place.
2020-01-06 14:02:52 <int-e> The reference to a variable register isn't a problem... just make the tape position part of the MM state.
2020-01-06 14:03:01 <kspalaiologos> ?
2020-01-06 14:03:03 <kspalaiologos> how
2020-01-06 14:03:21 <kspalaiologos> we can have just two registers, adding another variable to the state makes it very cheaty
2020-01-06 14:03:25 User Name: arseniiv = arseniiv!~arseniiv@136.169.232.104
2020-01-06 14:03:25 <arseniiv> hi hi hi
2020-01-06 14:03:39 <int-e> Make the MM state a pair of program position (in the brainfuck program) and current tape position (0,1,2)
2020-01-06 14:04:11 <kspalaiologos> in the runtime the state is constant?
2020-01-06 14:04:12 <int-e> That way a 3-cell Brainfuck program of length l becomes a MM with 3 registers and 3*l states.
2020-01-06 14:04:20 <kspalaiologos> no no no
2020-01-06 14:04:25 <kspalaiologos> I'm not interested in 3 registers
2020-01-06 14:04:26 <kspalaiologos> I want 2
2020-01-06 14:04:33 <int-e> And that preserves complexity.
2020-01-06 14:04:43 <int-e> *I*'m interested in preserving complexity here.
2020-01-06 14:04:43 <kspalaiologos> complexity doesn't bother me
2020-01-06 14:04:51 <kspalaiologos> well
2020-01-06 14:05:08 <int-e> You can do the usual m to 2 counters reduction afterwards.
2020-01-06 14:05:23 <int-e> At an exponential cost in runtime.
2020-01-06 14:05:44 <kspalaiologos> how
2020-01-06 14:05:45 <kspalaiologos> can I do that
2020-01-06 14:07:46 <int-e> You encode counters a,b,...,z as 2^a 3^b ... 101^z. You can do division with remainder using one more counter... so you can check whether any of the original registers is 0 (--> not divisible by the corresponding prime), and increment and decrement counters as well.
2020-01-06 14:08:02 <int-e> (did you know that 101 is the 26th prime...)
2020-01-06 14:08:28 <kspalaiologos> umm, not
2020-01-06 14:08:32 <kspalaiologos> *no
2020-01-06 14:08:46 <kspalaiologos> but I still don't understand it
2020-01-06 14:09:42 <int-e> increment b --> multiply the counter by 3. decrement b -> divide the counter by 3; if the remainder is 0, the decrement succeeds. Otherwise multiply by 3 and add the remainder back, and branch somewhere else.
2020-01-06 14:10:33 <int-e> (You can keep track of the remainder in the finite state of the Minsky machine, and of the quotient in the other counter.)
2020-01-06 14:11:00 <kspalaiologos> well
2020-01-06 14:11:00 <kspalaiologos> yes
2020-01-06 14:11:17 <kspalaiologos> but you need modulus
2020-01-06 14:11:29 <kspalaiologos> and there is NO way to implement it on a 2 register MM
2020-01-06 14:11:30 <int-e> that's what I just called remainder.
2020-01-06 14:11:39 <kspalaiologos> yes
2020-01-06 14:11:40 <kspalaiologos> I do realise
2020-01-06 14:11:44 <int-e> You're wrong.
2020-01-06 14:11:58 <kspalaiologos> how to do this
2020-01-06 14:11:59 <int-e> You just need many states.
2020-01-06 14:12:09 <int-e> Meh.
2020-01-06 14:14:12 <int-e> http://paste.debian.net/1124843/
2020-01-06 14:14:48 <int-e> It's important that we only ever divide by known constants.

2020-01-06 15:30:53 <Taneb> I should try to learn J again

2020-01-06 15:32:28 <Taneb> Never quite got the hooks and stuff last time
2020-01-06 15:32:29 <kspalaiologos> I'll probably read this one

2020-01-06 15:35:23 <kspalaiologos> I understand that J code above

2020-01-06 15:36:49 <Taneb> ^~ is a monad (in the J sense, not the Haskell sense) which computes x^x
2020-01-06 15:37:24 <kspalaiologos> << The symbol for division is % (percent). >>
2020-01-06 15:37:25 <kspalaiologos> gosh why
2020-01-06 15:37:42 <kspalaiologos> every single language uses slash for division
2020-01-06 15:37:50 <kritixilithos> it looks closer to the apl ˜
2020-01-06 15:38:09 <kspalaiologos> it has to be a joke
2020-01-06 15:38:20 <kspalaiologos> also, why is - turned into a floor (_)?
2020-01-06 15:38:30 <kritixilithos> `/` is used instead for reduce (and other stuff)
2020-01-06 15:38:31 <HackEso> ‚Äã/`? No such file or directory
2020-01-06 15:38:41 <wib_jonas> division should not get a precious single character symbol in any language, it's such a rare operation, it should just get named functions
2020-01-06 15:38:43 <kspalaiologos> interestinb
2020-01-06 15:39:54 <kritixilithos> kspalaiologos: because `-` is a function that can also be monadic, in which case it negates the right argument
2020-01-06 15:40:00 <FireFly> kspalaiologos: - is used for subtraction and unary negation, but _ is used in a negative number literal

2020-01-06 15:40:24 <kspalaiologos> it makes a tiny bit of sense
2020-01-06 15:40:41 <kspalaiologos> what does it mean that it's monadsic

2020-01-06 15:40:57 <wib_jonas> ^ this is why
2020-01-06 15:41:16 <wib_jonas> and it's also why standard ML uses a different character for unary negation, though their specific choice is objectionable
2020-01-06 15:41:24 <FireFly> I think most languages only let you express positive number literals, and simply have you apply negation on a positive literal

2020-01-06 15:45:34 <kspalaiologos> I managed to write a simple java powered kernel lately
2020-01-06 15:45:59 <kspalaiologos> it's based around stupid implementation of SE 1.5
2020-01-06 15:46:00 <kritixilithos> "this doesn‚Äôt change that J is a write-only esolang" apl OTOH isn't write-only, because the glyphs are easier to read

2020-01-06 15:59:04 <arseniiv> I often think that about myself too

2020-01-06 16:00:20 <wib_jonas> yeah
2020-01-06 16:00:27 <wib_jonas> hey, that doesn't have space before and after every paren
2020-01-06 16:00:42 <kspalaiologos> ()
2020-01-06 16:00:55 <arseniiv> once I thought that the language should have a rational implicit conversion for any occasion, between any two types, and a special syntax (instead of plain method/function names) for most operations on standard types
2020-01-06 16:00:58 <kspalaiologos> didn't copy it, because the code is long lost
2020-01-06 16:01:17 <wib_jonas> oh yeah, my old code has space between the function name and the call parenthesis too. also horrible
2020-01-06 16:01:37 <arseniiv> agree
2020-01-06 16:01:51 <arseniiv> I almost never wrote like that at least

2020-01-06 16:08:06 <kspalaiologos> without caring about operator precendence?
2020-01-06 16:08:20 <kspalaiologos> interesting
2020-01-06 16:08:52 <FireFly> well, the operator precedence is "all verbs are equal precedence", and verb evaluation is right to left, yes
2020-01-06 16:09:22 <FireFly> Iverson explained quite clearly why in one of his old papers on APL, I think it was in notation as a tool for thought
2020-01-06 16:09:38 <FireFly> https://www.jsoftware.com/papers/tot.htm
2020-01-06 16:10:19 <FireFly> in general, APL was developed as an alternate maths notation originally, designed to be more consistent than the conventional notation
2020-01-06 16:10:37 <FireFly> it also amongst other things introduced the notation for floor and ceiling that we use today

2020-01-06 16:12:26 <kspalaiologos> "A function taking a single argument on the right is called a monadic function, or a monad for short. "
2020-01-06 16:12:38 <kspalaiologos> so monad is just an unary function?
2020-01-06 16:13:06 <kspalaiologos> that's the real meaning of this buzzword which definition feels like reading Malbolge?

2020-01-06 16:14:46 <FireFly> kspalaiologos: compare "variadic", or the use of "monad", "dyad" in music
2020-01-06 16:14:51 <fizzie> The definitive definition is whatever's in our wisdom, of course.
2020-01-06 16:14:53 <fizzie> `? monad
2020-01-06 16:14:53 <FireFly> (yes, it refers to the number of arguments)
2020-01-06 16:14:54 <HackEso> Monads are just monoids in the category of endofunctors.
2020-01-06 16:14:57 <fizzie> `? endofunctor
2020-01-06 16:14:58 <HackEso> Endofunctors are just endomorphisms in the category of categories.
2020-01-06 16:15:00 <FireFly> see also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity#Terminology
2020-01-06 16:15:02 <fizzie> `? endomorphism
2020-01-06 16:15:05 <HackEso> Endomorphisms are just final morphisms.
2020-01-06 16:15:08 <fizzie> `? morphism
2020-01-06 16:15:10 <HackEso> A morphism is just a natural transformation between two diagrams of shape 1.
2020-01-06 16:15:13 <fizzie> See, so useful.
2020-01-06 16:15:21 <Taneb> `? final
2020-01-06 16:15:23 <HackEso> ‚Äã"final" is an annotation in Java; it means the marked code will not be changed anymore and is a final version.
2020-01-06 16:15:40 <fizzie> You have to pick words quite carefully to stay in the same domain of things.
2020-01-06 16:15:42 <fizzie> `? category
2020-01-06 16:15:43 <HackEso> A category is an enriched category where the enriching category is the category of classes.

2020-01-06 16:16:15 <FireFly> a lot of J's terminology is borrowed from linguistics, I'm not sure if the use of monadic/dyadic (which also existed back in APL) are derived from the musical terms..
2020-01-06 16:16:18 <arseniiv> so monad's definition varies by language? => I think these times ‚Äúmonadic‚Äù is far more often about category theory monads, not arity-one functions

2020-01-06 16:16:39 <HackEso> A kittegory is just a small category.
2020-01-06 16:16:39 <kmc> yes, sometimes "monadic" just means "1-adic"
2020-01-06 16:16:49 <kmc> or arity 1
2020-01-06 16:16:54 <kmc> oh it also has a meaning in philosophy

2020-01-06 16:22:23 <FireFly> or well, power

2020-01-06 16:22:29 <int-e> 0^0 is 1 of course.

2020-01-06 16:26:35 <int-e> arseniiv: People do not agree on this universally, of course. (There are some vocal people who think that x/0 should be left as unspecified as possible... it has a value, but you don't know what it is. But then you'll still have theorems like x/0 - x/0 = 0 that will annoy the purists that you were trying to please...)

2020-01-06 16:37:00 <kspalaiologos> can I make it enumerate alphabet?
2020-01-06 16:37:04 <kspalaiologos> or something else?
2020-01-06 16:37:22 <FireFly> Well not per se
2020-01-06 16:37:28 <kspalaiologos> there aren't really many operators here
2020-01-06 16:37:50 <arseniiv> bet I have seen `atoi` in some language, related to Œπ but don‚Äôt remember in what a way
2020-01-06 16:38:05 <kspalaiologos> but using this language already feels like driving a truck on thin ice
2020-01-06 16:38:07 <FireFly> isn't that just "string to integer"
2020-01-06 16:38:13 <kspalaiologos> yep it is
2020-01-06 16:38:13 <FireFly> kspalaiologos: how so?
2020-01-06 16:38:26 <kspalaiologos> seems illogical to me a bit
2020-01-06 16:38:31 <kspalaiologos> but probably because I'm not used to APL
2020-01-06 16:38:48 <kspalaiologos> is barely anyone using APL these days?
2020-01-06 16:39:20 <FireFly> Not sure, I'm told it's still used a bit in financial stuffs

2020-01-06 16:39:48 <Taneb> Didn't Phantom_Hoover get a job working with K?

2020-01-06 16:40:33 <kspalaiologos> FireFly, < K is the foundation for a family of financial products > -> you're right
2020-01-06 16:41:15 <FireFly> I think that K is kind of the theoretically beautiful, minimalistic language in the family.. although it's also fairly different from APL and J in terms of how its arrays work
2020-01-06 16:41:31 <FireFly> or well, it's more oriented around nested lists (a la lisps) than APL-style rectangular arrays
2020-01-06 16:41:41 <FireFly> J is much more "batteries included"

2020-01-06 17:12:03 <arseniiv> I like the alternate beat in the second at 0:30
2020-01-06 17:13:09 <kspalaiologos> 2nd one will be looped so it's quite short and the alternate beat was very important because it would feel terribly if the same part was looped over and over
2020-01-06 17:16:10 <arseniiv> agree

2020-01-06 17:16:40 <kspalaiologos> another very entertaining to watch trend?
2020-01-06 17:17:00 <kspalaiologos> random button on the wiki is very disappointing
2020-01-06 17:17:10 <kspalaiologos> in most cases I land either on trivial brainfuck derivative
2020-01-06 17:17:15 <kspalaiologos> or a joke language

2020-01-06 17:19:48 <ais523> perhaps constant-output languages should be split out of [[Category:Languages]] in order to discourage random spamming of trivially simple language ideas in order to discouarge attempts to bias the random-language functionality?
2020-01-06 17:20:08 <kspalaiologos> +1 from me
2020-01-06 17:20:12 <arseniiv> kspalaiologos: yeah, unfortunate :(
2020-01-06 17:20:18 <kspalaiologos> also, we really can merge all the brainfuck substitutions
2020-01-06 17:20:21 <kspalaiologos> into one article
2020-01-06 17:20:26 <arseniiv> ais523: looks interesting
2020-01-06 17:20:55 <kspalaiologos> or maybe enhanced random page button ?
2020-01-06 17:20:59 <kspalaiologos> (if its doable)
2020-01-06 17:21:09 <ais523> something I've been meaning to do for a while but never got around to was to write a metalanguage that generated BF-equivalents (and maybe some almost-equivalents)
2020-01-06 17:21:09 <kspalaiologos> that lets to filter out / in categories
2020-01-06 17:21:20 <ais523> for the purpose of being able to merge them all into a single page
2020-01-06 17:26:15 <kspalaiologos> can't someone run a perl script
2020-01-06 17:26:18 <kspalaiologos> on the server
2020-01-06 17:26:41 <kspalaiologos> to merge all pages containing the [[:Category:Trivial Brainfuck Substitution]] (or something along these lines)
2020-01-06 17:26:56 <kspalaiologos> it could be done even using shell script
2020-01-06 17:27:15 <ais523> MediaWiki's DB organisation is kind-of fragile, it's certainly possible to do that but I wouldn't be at all confident the script was touching every table it needed to in the correct way
2020-01-06 17:27:38 <kspalaiologos> then maybe use selenium?
2020-01-06 17:27:43 <kspalaiologos> to automate the browser
2020-01-06 17:28:07 <ais523> fwiw I'd be much more confident doing something like that client-side via a tool like AWB
2020-01-06 17:28:28 <kspalaiologos> whats awb
2020-01-06 17:28:44 <kspalaiologos> k AutoWikiBrowser
2020-01-06 17:29:55 <kspalaiologos> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser/CheckPage#Approved_users
2020-01-06 17:29:57 <kspalaiologos> what an idiotism
2020-01-06 17:30:11 <kspalaiologos> a power user will just nop out the statements used for the check
2020-01-06 17:30:17 <kspalaiologos> if it's open source its even easier
2020-01-06 17:31:12 <ais523> kspalaiologos: it's pretty good at keeping out script kiddies
2020-01-06 17:31:26 <kspalaiologos> in which way?
2020-01-06 17:31:34 <kspalaiologos> there's no source
2020-01-06 17:31:38 <ais523> they don't even know how to override the check
2020-01-06 17:31:40 <kspalaiologos> so it's easy
2020-01-06 17:31:48 <kspalaiologos> just use dotPeek
2020-01-06 17:32:07 <kspalaiologos> or a proxy
2020-01-06 17:32:28 <kspalaiologos> that will add my username to the wiki page, there must be a programmable tool for that
2020-01-06 17:32:31 <ais523> also, the list is enforced two ways: both by the tool itself, and by Wikipedia administrators who can block accounts that are using automated editing illegally
2020-01-06 17:32:49 <kspalaiologos> block is delayed
2020-01-06 17:32:55 <kspalaiologos> whoever wants to do it will do it
2020-01-06 17:32:59 <ais523> it's pretty hard to bypass the check in the tool unknowingly
2020-01-06 17:33:13 <kspalaiologos> it seems like a cool thing to do this afternoon
2020-01-06 17:33:28 <kspalaiologos> obviously I won't "test it"
2020-01-06 17:33:46 <ais523> so using the tool contrary to the checkpage check is pretty strong evidence that someone is intentionally trying to violate policy
2020-01-06 17:34:15 <kspalaiologos> protection on the clientside is useless
2020-01-06 17:34:55 <kspalaiologos> other approach should be taken
2020-01-06 17:34:59 <ais523> the thing is, on Wikipedia anything can be reverted
2020-01-06 17:35:07 <kspalaiologos> ratelimits, have they heard of it
2020-01-06 17:35:11 <ais523> and someone having bypassed a clientside check is good evidence that it /should/ be reverted
2020-01-06 17:35:27 <kspalaiologos> possibly but reverting in batch can be sometimes bad
2020-01-06 17:35:43 <kspalaiologos> maybe the user mixed good and bad contributions? maybe someone already touched the page since "change"?
2020-01-06 17:35:47 <ais523> yes, that's why it's a good idea to have a system that lets you know whether reverting in batch is likely to be helpful
2020-01-06 17:35:47 <kspalaiologos> just add ratelimits
2020-01-06 17:36:00 <kspalaiologos> ratelimits on edits, no more than a page per minute
2020-01-06 17:36:02 <ais523> also, I'm pretty sure there are systems that check to see if an account is editing too fast
2020-01-06 17:36:11 <kspalaiologos> they have to check the list
2020-01-06 17:36:14 <kspalaiologos> possibly
2020-01-06 17:36:16 <ais523> that's one of the things the "bot flag" on an account is for, it disables the rate limits
2020-01-06 17:36:22 <kspalaiologos> so the clientside protection is useless
2020-01-06 17:36:25 <kspalaiologos> as the backend will take care
2020-01-06 17:36:37 <ais523> but that has to be set manually and there's vetting of the user/bot first
2020-01-06 17:36:56 <kspalaiologos> manually?
2020-01-06 17:37:10 <kspalaiologos> just get an automated system that trashes account of an user that makes more than two edits a second constantly
2020-01-06 17:37:38 <ais523> kspalaiologos: no, I mean permission to bypass rate limits has to be given manually
2020-01-06 17:37:49 <kspalaiologos> like the entry on checklist
2020-01-06 17:38:01 <ais523> the rate limits themselves are probably automatic, although I don't think I have perms to check atm
2020-01-06 17:38:12 <kspalaiologos> you're a wikipedia admin?
2020-01-06 17:38:14 <kspalaiologos> interesting
2020-01-06 17:38:43 <kspalaiologos> c'mon man
2020-01-06 17:38:47 <ais523> not right now, I was at one time though (I resigned due to lack of activity)
2020-01-06 17:38:49 <kspalaiologos> they havent even obfuscated the assembly
2020-01-06 17:39:37 <ais523> the abuse filter configuration is stored in a non-public database; however, there is a public page listing a subset of it, but it's unclear whether rate limits would be in the public or the private subset
2020-01-06 17:40:03 <kspalaiologos> I haven't dug through mediawiki
2020-01-06 17:40:18 <ais523> looking at the source code for this would be pointless because it's a configuration setting, not hardcoded
2020-01-06 17:42:09 <ais523> OK, I checked the public part of the configuration: it states that a rate limit exists; however, the exact numbers are not public
2020-01-06 17:42:46 <kspalaiologos> << This user doesn't have enough privileges to make automatic edits on this wiki. >>
2020-01-06 17:42:57 <kspalaiologos> a check and the messagebox below
2020-01-06 17:47:50 <fizzie> You just said the client-side protection is useless, now you're complaining about them not spending enough effort on it.
2020-01-06 17:49:39 <kspalaiologos> well, you see
2020-01-06 17:49:46 <kspalaiologos> when someone makes clientside protection
2020-01-06 17:49:50 <kspalaiologos> they either resign before making it
2020-01-06 17:49:54 <kspalaiologos> or make it hard to overcome
2020-01-06 17:50:10 <ais523> or duplicate it on the server side
2020-01-06 17:50:13 <kspalaiologos> there are no inbetweeners, because it has no sense to implement weak protection
2020-01-06 17:50:52 <ais523> client-side validation that's duplicated on the server-side is pretty helpful because it saves the server time dealing with known bad values, and saves the user time too because the client-side check is faster when using a slow Internet connection
2020-01-06 17:51:02 <kspalaiologos> wait
2020-01-06 17:51:06 <kspalaiologos> for a clientside check
2020-01-06 17:51:10 <kspalaiologos> they first connect to the wiki
2020-01-06 17:51:15 <kspalaiologos> download allowed nicks list
2020-01-06 17:51:27 <ais523> I'm talking in general here, rather than about AWB in particular
2020-01-06 17:51:27 <kspalaiologos> and then they check whether the client can proceed or not
2020-01-06 17:51:39 <kspalaiologos> well AWB uses inet connection for a clientside check
2020-01-06 17:51:43 <ais523> in AWB, the server-side duplication is a little less accurate because it isn't always 100% obvious whether someone's using AWB or not
2020-01-06 17:51:44 <kspalaiologos> so your argument is invalid
2020-01-06 17:52:05 <ais523> which is the reason why the client-side check helps there
2020-01-06 17:52:29 <kspalaiologos> it's not effective
2020-01-06 17:52:44 <kspalaiologos> it would be a shame if (*cough*) someone, released an unlocked version.
2020-01-06 17:52:49 <kspalaiologos> that's why it doesn't work
2020-01-06 17:53:13 <ais523> people bypassing the check basically just costs the Wikipedia administrators time in cleaning the issue up, it doesn't do lasting damage
2020-01-06 17:53:29 <kspalaiologos> it shouldn't cost anything
2020-01-06 17:53:40 <ais523> so having an imperfect check is a good time-saving device, compared to having no client-side check
2020-01-06 17:53:46 <kspalaiologos> if ratelimits were optimally implemented
2020-01-06 17:54:17 <ais523> there are rate limits, but manual edits can go pretty quickly sometimes
2020-01-06 17:54:25 <kspalaiologos> how quickly?
2020-01-06 17:54:29 <ais523> I think I managed something like 8/minute manually cleaning up spam
2020-01-06 17:54:50 <ais523> so the rate limits, despite not being public, are likely set to something comparable to that
2020-01-06 17:54:52 <kspalaiologos> and you think that automatic tool will edit at 8 edits a minute?
2020-01-06 17:54:57 <kspalaiologos> it'll go like crazy
2020-01-06 17:55:11 <ais523> it can go much faster in full-auto mode, but that would be noticed
2020-01-06 17:55:16 <ais523> and blocked very quickly
2020-01-06 17:55:25 <kspalaiologos> well that's a point
2020-01-06 17:55:46 <ais523> 30-60/minute is common for full-auto bots, with maxlag compensation
2020-01-06 17:56:13 <kspalaiologos> anyways I think clientside check is nonsense
2020-01-06 17:56:30 <ais523> you think it would be better to not have the check?
2020-01-06 17:56:33 <kspalaiologos> my friend used to put anti-scriptkiddie check in his CS1.7 (or whatever it was called) bot
2020-01-06 17:56:37 <wib_jonas> are you talking about irc rate limiting and jeval's rate limiter? I can tell you about these
2020-01-06 17:56:46 <kspalaiologos> wikimedia
2020-01-06 17:56:52 <ais523> there's a statement along the lines of "locks are to keep out honest users", this will prevent anyone honest using it without getting authorisation
2020-01-06 17:57:01 <kspalaiologos> ais523, strengthten the check to make it more effective
2020-01-06 17:57:06 <kspalaiologos> OR get rid of it completely
2020-01-06 17:57:10 <wib_jonas> oh, wiki edits?
2020-01-06 17:57:16 <kspalaiologos> just think of power users
2020-01-06 17:57:22 <kspalaiologos> even a script kiddie can download a macro program
2020-01-06 17:57:25 <kspalaiologos> that will record mouseclocks
2020-01-06 17:57:28 <kspalaiologos> *mouseclicks
2020-01-06 17:57:29 <kspalaiologos> and keystrokes
2020-01-06 17:57:30 <ais523> it's easy to bypass by someone who wants to be an issue, but those people are rare, and the existence of the check makes it clear that such people are being intentionally unconstructive when they get caught (which normally happens quickly)
2020-01-06 17:58:07 <wib_jonas> I guess I'll have to read this scrollback later, gtg now
2020-01-06 17:58:18 <kspalaiologos> well
