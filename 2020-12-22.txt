2020-12-22 02:51:20 <b_jonas> https://xkcd.com/2401/ => wait, wasn't that in November? or were they just already close in November, with Mars also close to them, but actually got closest now?

2020-12-22 02:53:59 <kmc> I just got back from viewing it in the park here
2020-12-22 02:54:02 <kmc> was kinda neat
2020-12-22 02:54:04 <kmc> we saw Mars too
2020-12-22 02:54:09 <kmc> but Mars was pretty far away in the sky

2020-12-22 02:57:22 <kmc> is it just coincidence that this is happening on the solstice or is that astronomically related somehow
