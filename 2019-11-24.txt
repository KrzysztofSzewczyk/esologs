2019-11-24 00:15:02 <zzo38> What is it a picture of?
2019-11-24 00:15:50 <imode> a mountain pass with a terrain painter I wrote this afternoon to figure out how someone generated a particular image.
2019-11-24 00:57:48 <zzo38> If I add up all of the numbers in the RSS column from "ps aux" output, it adds up to 397288 which is less than the amount obtained by subtracting the buffer and cache amounts from the used amount by the "free" command. Why is it?
2019-11-24 00:58:40 <zzo38> (Adding "sudo" doesn't help)
2019-11-24 01:05:59 <zzo38> I know that some memory is shared, but I don't know how to make a proper division of the memory usage.

2019-11-24 02:34:19 <lambdabot> fizzie said 14h 39s ago: Actually, it might have been in the bot, not in the MediaWiki component. I wanted to filter out control characters (0-2, 4-31, 127) but due to signedness of char I may have
2019-11-24 02:34:19 <lambdabot> intentionally also filtered all bytes >127 as well.

2019-11-24 02:59:15 <zzo38> I fixed ZZ Zero so now the main game loop uses INP(96) to read the keyboard instead of INKEY$ so the problem of repeat rate is solved, but there is another problem is if you push two keys at once and release one, sometimes it isn't recognized, because the released code will be received and then the pushed code won't be received until it starts to repeat
2019-11-24 02:59:21 <zzo38> And this results in a delay.
2019-11-24 03:01:23 <moony> zzo38: what you making, and for what hardwarE?
2019-11-24 03:01:50 <zzo38> It is a game creation system similar to ZZT, and the hardware is PC
2019-11-24 03:03:07 <zzo38> You can download the latest version (currently 0.4) from http://zzo38computer.org/prog/zzzero.zip
2019-11-24 03:04:24 <zzo38> I also set up a NNTP for discussion of it
2019-11-24 03:04:38 <moony> zzo38: DOS?
2019-11-24 03:04:52 <zzo38> Yes
2019-11-24 03:04:54 <moony> should I run it under FreeDOS?
2019-11-24 03:05:18 <zzo38> You can try; it probably would work. It also works under DOSBOX.
2019-11-24 03:05:59 <zzo38> There are also a few other problems currently, such as the editor isn't very good, and the rotation map editor is slow
2019-11-24 03:06:25 <zzo38> Have you used ZZT?
2019-11-24 03:07:51 <moony> Nope
2019-11-24 03:08:11 <moony> In fact I rarely use DOS. I usually write my nonsense for console hardware
2019-11-24 03:08:28 <moony> i.e. the Gameboy, and I plan to do something for the Sega Saturn
2019-11-24 03:12:34 <zzo38> Have you written any program for NES/Famicom?
2019-11-24 03:16:23 <moony> zzo38: Considered it multiple times, and know what goes into it

2019-11-24 03:34:19 <zzo38> Does ZZ Zero working for you?
2019-11-24 03:35:09 <moony> waiting for FreeDOS to download, zzo38
2019-11-24 03:35:48 <moony> oh just finished, lemme install it, and then i'll try it
2019-11-24 03:37:11 <zzo38> It also works in DOSBOX though
2019-11-24 03:37:24 <moony> don't have DOSBOX installed either :p
2019-11-24 03:37:59 <zzo38> O, OK
2019-11-24 03:48:25 <moony> zzo38: what's this unusenet you speak of

2019-11-24 03:48:58 <zzo38> Unusenet is a form of NNTP newsgroup hierarchies which are not part of Usenet.
2019-11-24 03:49:18 <moony> mm. how do I access it? :P
2019-11-24 03:49:39 <zzo38> They do not conflict with Usenet (and you can serve both from the same server if you wish), because all Unusenet newsgroup names must start with "un" followed by one or more digits and then a dot.
2019-11-24 03:49:49 <zzo38> moony: Access it with any NNTP client.
2019-11-24 03:50:08 <zzo38> (Or just telnet to the NNTP server, although using specialized NNTP software is better.)
2019-11-24 03:50:51 <moony> I haven't used usenet in a long while and completely forgot how to set up a NNTP client
2019-11-24 03:50:52 <moony> aaaa
2019-11-24 03:52:05 <zzo38> There are actually many different Unusenet hierarchies, but as far as I know the only one actually in use is where the digits after "un" are the number of components in the reverse domain name (all other Unusenet hierarchies start "un0.").
2019-11-24 03:52:36 <zzo38> I also wrote my own NNTP client software, called bystand, and supports connecting to multiple servers (I have it connect to my own server and to nntp.aioe.org)
2019-11-24 03:54:37 <zzo38> Or just use netcat or telnet or whatever and write raw messages. I implemented a POSTQUIT command for the convenience of users who do not have specialized NNTP software, even.
