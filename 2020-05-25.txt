2020-05-25 00:00:40 <imode> it's definitely not a pretty language, but you can do some interesting things in it.
2020-05-25 00:00:55 <imode> for example, you can define what `if` and `if/else` are.
2020-05-25 00:01:03 <orbitaldecay> Nice, hopping in the car but will read shortly. Here's what I'm working on https://esolangs.org/wiki/User:Orby/Term_rewriting_metalanguage
2020-05-25 00:01:10 <imode> been reading that.
2020-05-25 00:01:14 <imode> looks neat.
2020-05-25 00:02:44 <imode> if is just `def [true if] [rapply] def [false if] [rdrop]`
2020-05-25 00:03:08 <imode> if/else is `def [true if/else] [rapply rdrop rswap] def [false if/else] [rapply rdrop]`
2020-05-25 00:05:12 <imode> it's not satisfying because you still have all those pre-defined things in the way. I guess I just like stuff like Thue more because you have no assumptions other than "I will replace this thing with this other thing at random".
2020-05-25 00:05:50 <imode> out of chaos on a 1D line, you can enforce order.
2020-05-25 00:05:54 <orbitaldecay> Hatebin link is not loading. Confirm?
2020-05-25 00:06:21 <imode> loading for me.
2020-05-25 00:06:43 <orbitaldecay> Hmm, will try again
2020-05-25 00:16:05 <orbitaldecay> I hate to be a bother, but could you post it somewhere else? I really want to read what you're working on but hatebin in timing out for me.

2020-05-25 00:31:38 <imode> weird that hatebin is timing out.
2020-05-25 00:32:19 <orbitaldecay> Definitely, thank you reading now
2020-05-25 00:34:53 <imode> I think the problem is that there's way too many assumptions baked into the interpreter here.
2020-05-25 00:36:43 <imode> it's not really a "rewriting language" if you aren't utilizing the rewriting part of it any further than base cases.
2020-05-25 00:38:20 <b_jonas> I don't see spruit's language as a "term rewriting language" either, even though he claims it's a term rewriting language

2020-05-25 00:51:04 <imode> it's not satisfying to write in a language with pre-baked assumptions. it's more fun to build those things.
2020-05-25 00:54:30 <orbitaldecay> imode: What you have there reminds me a lot of concatenative combinators
2020-05-25 00:55:28 <imode> yeah. it kinda just popped out.
2020-05-25 00:55:29 <orbitaldecay> Have you read the paper by Brent Kirby? I think you'd find use for it here
2020-05-25 00:55:50 <orbitaldecay> It's very accessible too
2020-05-25 00:55:55 <imode> Concatenative Calculus?
2020-05-25 00:56:05 <imode> theory of concatenative combinators, I take it.
2020-05-25 00:56:15 <orbitaldecay> correct
2020-05-25 00:56:23 <imode> yeah, I've been all around the concatenative scene.
2020-05-25 00:56:48 <orbitaldecay> Gotcha, I've only stumbled onto it recently
2020-05-25 00:57:46 <imode> it's an interesting idea. the language (and interpreter) has left and right-handed versions of all of the combinators (dup swap drop quote cat call).
2020-05-25 00:58:07 <orbitaldecay> It seems to me like what you need is a good basis to work with
2020-05-25 00:58:14 <imode> it just doesn't strike me as satisfying.
2020-05-25 00:58:28 <imode> you pre-suppose things and quoted lists of things.

2020-05-25 00:59:28 <orbitaldecay> And you'd prefer to build those lists out of some other primitive?
