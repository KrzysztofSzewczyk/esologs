2020-03-09 00:21:19 <kmc> zzo38: interesting, do you know why they use a separate black layer?
2020-03-09 00:22:02 <b_jonas> kmc: they do that for most color printing, different ink for the black in the full color parts and in the black and white parts
2020-03-09 00:22:22 <b_jonas> kmc: even most home printers have separate black inks for them, except for some very cheap ones
2020-03-09 00:23:06 <b_jonas> it's nothing specific for M:tG
2020-03-09 00:23:12 <int-e> . o O ( Which are probably very expensive in the long run, and have awful looking text. )
2020-03-09 00:23:14 <b_jonas> mind you, M:tG does use other special printing technology
2020-03-09 00:23:51 <b_jonas> including I think printing the back in a different way than the front, to keep the back hard to distinguish between different sets while the front can become nicer
2020-03-09 00:23:52 <int-e> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_color also comes up
2020-03-09 00:24:38 <int-e> (Generally. I don't quite understand why M:tG comes up here... nerds!)
2020-03-09 00:25:24 <b_jonas> int-e: why does category theory come up here? nerds
2020-03-09 00:26:05 <int-e> b_jonas: I know, right?
2020-03-09 00:26:55 <int-e> But I honestly didn't expect people to care about how M:tG cards are *printed*.
2020-03-09 00:26:59 <b_jonas> and SAT solvers and comparison of different proof systems
2020-03-09 00:27:24 <b_jonas> int-e: I do care about that sort of thing, typography looking nice
2020-03-09 00:27:32 <int-e> b_jonas: Obviously I'm embracing that label myself.
2020-03-09 00:27:32 <b_jonas> not only for M:tG cards
2020-03-09 00:27:57 <b_jonas> like Knuth says, "I can't eat in a restaurant because I only see what font is used on the menu."
2020-03-09 00:28:09 <int-e> kemming
2020-03-09 00:28:21 <b_jonas> oh yeah
2020-03-09 00:28:22 <int-e> (why did I put a second 'm' in there)
2020-03-09 00:28:24 <b_jonas> `? font

2020-03-09 00:28:29 <b_jonas> ^ this one is characteristic of the channel
2020-03-09 00:29:06 <b_jonas> I should add more characters to mine some day
2020-03-09 00:29:22 <int-e> b_jonas: Anyway, I apologize if you felt insulted.
2020-03-09 00:29:31 <b_jonas> I'm not insulted
