2020-04-08 00:51:39 <imode> maybe some common sense can set me straight: I'm building a service. bit of a "high-class" version of LambdaMOO with an economy attached to the middle of it. in it, I need to be able to run user-submitted code. arbitrary user-submitted code.
2020-04-08 00:52:30 <imode> this code needs to be sandboxed. so, I turn to "popular" tools. node.js springs to mind. seems alright enough. I have a couple of things like a job queue, an SQL ORM, websocket support...
2020-04-08 00:52:58 <imode> I'm at a crossroads between two options. do I use something like a Forth, or PostScript. or do I use sandboxed JavaScript.

2020-04-08 00:53:48 <imode> I figured I'd first ask the esolangs channel because, why not. esolangs are kind of at the opposite end of the UX spectrum.

2020-04-08 00:54:25 <FreeFull> imode: I'd do some sort of language-independent sandboxing instead
2020-04-08 00:55:00 <imode> FreeFull: I'd take that route too. but there's a lot of variables associated with that.
2020-04-08 00:55:02 <FreeFull> Actually, no, language-independent wouldn't be enough
2020-04-08 00:55:27 <imode> bear in mind. user code runs per-command.
2020-04-08 00:55:36 <FreeFull> Maybe Lua?
2020-04-08 00:55:46 <imode> no good way to do memory limits.
2020-04-08 00:55:55 <imode> or CPU time measurements.
2020-04-08 00:56:18 <imode> imagine 10k+ users, all frothing at the chance to knock your machines out of memory.
2020-04-08 00:57:54 <imode> it's essentially a choice between creating a slightly user-hostile environment, sacrificing user experience for simplicity and control, vs. using V8 isolates via an npm package called `isolated-vm`.

2020-04-08 01:03:27 <FreeFull> I'd go for something where there's a separate sandboxed process, and some sort of API to communicate with the main server process
2020-04-08 01:08:33 <imode> I guess I'm also discounting what people did for the DCPU-16 or whatever that was.
2020-04-08 01:09:17 <imode> for a game that never even released.
2020-04-08 01:13:46 <FreeFull> You could have an entire virtual machine with its own instruction set, but that's definitely a bit overkill
2020-04-08 01:14:20 <imode> I already have some prior work that does this.
2020-04-08 01:15:15 <imode> which is why I'm torn. it brings up questions as to why JavaScript grew to be so popular, and whether an application's extensability mechanism will be used in spite of its current popularity.

2020-04-08 01:20:38 <zzo38> Be careful if using the sandboxing in Node.js; use Object.create(null) to create the sandbox object, and don't put in any objects that come from outside of the sandbox.
2020-04-08 01:20:53 <imode> I'd be using https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm
2020-04-08 01:21:00 <FreeFull> Javascript is popular because it's pretty much only programming language all popular web browsers support
2020-04-08 01:21:48 <zzo38> However, PostScript might work (in -dSAFER mode, which is now the default; you can also use writable systemdict to delete some entries that you don't want before locking it; for example, you probably don't need any of the graphics operations or device operations), and making your own variant of Forth could also work.
2020-04-08 01:22:15 <zzo38> You could also use other implementations of JavaScript, and write your own interface to it.
2020-04-08 01:22:59 <zzo38> There are many other possibilities too.
2020-04-08 01:23:19 <imode> FreeFull: right. so it's popular based on the strength of its userbase, because its userbase is derived from people that use a web browser, and people that want to create things that fit in a web browser.
2020-04-08 01:23:44 <zzo38> But in order to do memory limits and CPU time limits, you would do something else, such as setrlimit.
2020-04-08 01:24:33 <zzo38> There is also, as mentioned, Lua, and also SQL, even. And actually there are many other possibilities too.
2020-04-08 01:27:37 <imode> which possibilities will people actually tolerate, is the question.
2020-04-08 01:28:21 <zzo38> I think different people may tolerate different things, perhaps.
2020-04-08 01:28:57 <imode> I don't think my users want to do stack juggling in their heads.
2020-04-08 01:29:20 <zzo38> Something that other programming languages can be compiled to might be helpful, maybe.
2020-04-08 01:29:32 <imode> I was looking into WASM, but it's very immature.
2020-04-08 01:32:00 <zzo38> I might use a VM such as Glulx, although as far as I know none of the other programming languages listed can be compiled as Glulx code (and you may need your own I/O system too; this is possible if needed)
