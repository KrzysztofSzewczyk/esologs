2020-12-16 00:01:06 <nakilon> there should be a competitive website about optimizing funge solutions
2020-12-16 00:03:30 <nakilon> for example, measuring path length
2020-12-16 00:04:27 <nakilon> would make for RASEL if I had another life to spare

2020-12-16 00:14:45 <fizzie> Back when I used to golf Befunge with friends, bounding box area was our standard metric.
2020-12-16 00:15:07 <fizzie> There's just something very pleasing about a compact square of Befunge code with no appreciable gaps.
2020-12-16 00:15:59 <fizzie> (I've not written anything large that I'd've applied that style to, though.)
2020-12-16 00:22:48 <nakilon> that's actually an interesting aspect I didn't think about earlier -- the branch we are on has a 1 bit of information in itself

2020-12-16 00:23:51 <nakilon> it can be short but useful to get deeper into stack
2020-12-16 00:25:14 <nakilon> fizzie I use as a metric a bytesize of the file when you save it and editor trims trailing spaces
2020-12-16 00:26:14 <nakilon> you could use the metric of width+height to promote more squared solutions )

2020-12-16 00:26:48 <fizzie> Or the circumference, for round.
2020-12-16 00:27:35 <fizzie> Well, some approximation of length of convex hull or whatever.

2020-12-16 00:45:33 <fizzie> Hmm. I was hoping day 5 part 1 would've turned out to be real short, but http://ix.io/2Ier is what I got for it.
2020-12-16 00:51:10 <fizzie> Heh, at least I can use the same bucket sort for part 2: http://ix.io/2Iet -- also moderately happy that only took 5 minutes, and worked the first try. Somehow it's so easy to make mistakes with Befunge code.
2020-12-16 00:51:40 <fizzie> Whoops, it's even got some dead code left over from part 1. :)
2020-12-16 00:52:35 <b_jonas> fizzie: wouldn't bounding box area usually end up with a very narrow rectangle?

2020-12-16 00:53:47 <fizzie> Hmm, maybe in an actual competitive setting it might.
2020-12-16 00:54:20 <b_jonas> fizzie: especially in variants of befunge that have long jumps
2020-12-16 00:54:58 <b_jonas> I admit when we wrote obfuscated code in perl, a lot of them ended up as compact rectangles, but it's sort of an uninspired formatting
2020-12-16 00:55:35 <b_jonas> so much that I gave two variants in https://www.perlmonks.com/?node_id=863110 , and I think the one that's not an unformatted blob is nicer
2020-12-16 00:55:47 <b_jonas> but then befunge is different, because of its 2d control flow
2020-12-16 01:15:31 <nakilon> oh finally I made day 2 part 2
2020-12-16 01:16:26 <nakilon> fizzie https://dpaste.org/Crmx/slim
2020-12-16 01:17:11 <nakilon> it's basically Befunge-like solution, those "j" are accepting just 1 and 0 and so similar to _ and |
2020-12-16 01:17:50 <nakilon> almost in the middle there is branching that does a little of action and storing the 0 or 1
2020-12-16 01:18:17 <nakilon> and at the end another branch uses that saved bit to chose the branch
2020-12-16 01:18:58 <nakilon> I mean and at the end that bit is reused to branch again
2020-12-16 01:21:00 <nakilon> *Befunge-like and no random access
2020-12-16 01:25:34 <nakilon> "j" pointing from opposite sides are effectively the same as XORing the memorized bit
2020-12-16 01:28:28 <nakilon> hmmmm, what if I make "?" not "go forward or reverse" but "go 1 cell forward or 2"?..
2020-12-16 01:29:20 <nakilon> would look the same as I do with ":/j" to test for zero
