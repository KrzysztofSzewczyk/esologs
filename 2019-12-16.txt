2019-12-16 00:32:02 <oerjan> possibly during a previous date
2019-12-16 00:33:05 <oerjan> oh i missed the previous one
2019-12-16 00:37:57 * kmc reads about ZZT-OOP
2019-12-16 00:38:01 <kmc> seems pretty esoteric
2019-12-16 00:39:27 <kmc> > ZZT-OOP is restrictive, but in a fun way. Because the language was only meant for simple adventure games, code that would be easy in other languages becomes a challenge in ZZT-OOP. However, some of us live for such challenges, and although it won't get you a date or a job, being able to code complex things - a fractal generation program, for example - using only an archaic game creation system is rather

2019-12-16 00:39:33 <kmc> impressive.
2019-12-16 00:39:37 <kmc> i think under the right circumstances one could get a date or a job this way
2019-12-16 00:47:03 <kmc> the ability to zap/restore labels, even in another object's program is interesting
2019-12-16 00:49:25 <kmc> do all objects execute in lockstep?
2019-12-16 00:58:32 <zzo38> Yes, ZZT-OOP is working like that. Have you used ZZT-OOP?
2019-12-16 00:59:22 <int-e> oerjan: spoilers... but this doesn't sound like Florence will be eating soup any time soon
2019-12-16 00:59:53 <int-e> oerjan: I believe we've seen her lap water from a bowl though?
2019-12-16 01:00:02 <int-e> oerjan: I expect soup would be the same.
2019-12-16 01:00:34 <zzo38> Although making stuff in ZZT involves more than just ZZT-OOP; there is also programming the stats and board configuration, including many things not possible using the built-in editor (you will have to use external editors, such as KevEdit or ZZTQED, for some things)
2019-12-16 01:03:13 <kmc> zzo38: I haven't used ZZT or ZZT-OOP yet
2019-12-16 01:03:32 <kmc> what sort of things are not possible using the built-in editor?
2019-12-16 01:06:19 <zzo38> Preset laser beams, abnormal directions, abnormal speeds, statless pieces that are normally stat or vice versa, preset bullets/stars/beams, putting arbitrary elements under stats, setting the starting health/ammo/gems/torches/keys, and many other things.

2019-12-16 02:08:59 <Kaynato> Is there any good way to prove something *isn't* TC? Hmm
2019-12-16 02:12:50 <b_jonas> Kaynato: the most common way is to prove that you can translate the program of the language to finite state pushdown automata
2019-12-16 02:13:18 <b_jonas> plus there are some more trivial special cases that are easier to prove
2019-12-16 02:13:26 <oerjan> prove that you can predict its equivalent of the halting problem
2019-12-16 02:14:54 <b_jonas> in Slashes, what is the simplest way to write an infinite loop that fetches a new pattern infinitely many times?
2019-12-16 02:15:21 <b_jonas> not necessarily a different pattern, just a new pattern, it doesn't loop within a single substitution, such as a substitution with empty pattern
2019-12-16 02:16:19 <oerjan> as far as i know you need a quine-like construction once you have more than one substitution involved
2019-12-16 02:17:01 <b_jonas> Kaynato: oh, and there are programming languages that can only do primitive recursive loops, but that comes up less often
2019-12-16 02:17:02 <oerjan> but maybe you could do a special case just for an infinite loop

2019-12-16 02:21:30 <Kaynato> I'd look more at treating daoyu as a FSPA but the self-modification and obtuse data structure make it ... problematic to wrap my head around
2019-12-16 02:24:16 <b_jonas> oh, I should check Rosetta Code, maybe it has such a program

2019-12-16 02:24:42 <b_jonas> as in Push-Down Automaton
2019-12-16 02:24:45 <Kaynato> ah, thanks
2019-12-16 02:25:10 <b_jonas> note though that that can refer to both the deterministic version and the nondeterministic version, which are different
2019-12-16 02:26:06 <b_jonas> nope, can't find anything about /// on Rosetta Code
2019-12-16 02:26:36 <oerjan> it may be hard to search for
2019-12-16 02:26:43 <b_jonas> yeah
2019-12-16 02:26:58 <b_jonas> but they usually have an index page for every language
2019-12-16 02:27:18 <b_jonas> s/every/each/
2019-12-16 02:28:59 <b_jonas> I'd like to note that such an infinite loop in Fuun DNA is much simpler because, even though it only does one substitution for each pattern-replacement that it reads, the pattern can wildcard match and the replacement can copy matched parts, so it can just duplicate whatever is ahead if it, leading to a simple print<< x2 style quine
