2020-08-26 00:10:53 <int-e> fungot: how many CPU-hours are there in a day?
2020-08-26 00:10:53 <fungot> int-e: to fnord you notes online so i can part channels with :wq :)
2020-08-26 00:11:28 <fizzie> fungot: Is the universe just a large computing system?
2020-08-26 00:11:28 <fungot> fizzie: riastradh also owns the upstairs apartment, so i could put the cable in car and when list in cdr of a 3 element list?
2020-08-26 00:11:44 <int-e> That last part. Cute. I don't think the context it long enough to connect 'part' with ':wq' though :)
2020-08-26 00:13:07 <int-e> The universe isn't very central.
2020-08-26 00:13:08 <fizzie> It was, in fact, a literal quote from #scheme from May 2005.
2020-08-26 00:13:16 <int-e> Oh, it learns nicks. Wow.

2020-08-26 00:13:30 <fizzie> <Maddas> Bodger: I can part channels with :wq :-)
2020-08-26 00:13:37 <int-e> Ah
2020-08-26 00:13:54 <int-e> That's kind of sad.
2020-08-26 00:14:11 <int-e> (I liked it better when I thought it was fungot's invention.)
2020-08-26 00:14:11 <fungot> int-e: i'm mainly thinking of downward continuations.
2020-08-26 00:14:30 <int-e> fungot: That way leads straight into hell.
2020-08-26 00:14:30 <fungot> int-e: uh... okay. thanks, krystof.)
2020-08-26 00:14:42 <int-e> Hmm, more nicks.
2020-08-26 00:14:47 <fizzie> Yes. I was kind of expecting it to be a #esoteric quote rather than a #scheme quote, because it feels like people on this channel would be more likely to do that.
2020-08-26 00:15:03 <int-e> zzo typical?
2020-08-26 00:15:19 Quit: t20kdc (Remote host closed the connection)

2020-08-26 00:16:02 <fizzie> I think I stripped out "<anything nick-like>[:;,]" at the beginning of each line, but it still learns nicks if they're mentioned often enough in a context other than that.
2020-08-26 00:17:26 <int-e> So we should be talking less about Riastradh and Krystof? :-P
2020-08-26 00:17:56 <fizzie> Well, it's too late *now*.
2020-08-26 00:17:57 <int-e> As <nick> said, ...
2020-08-26 00:18:20 <int-e> I assumed it was too late, otherwise I'd have ^O-protected those.
2020-08-26 00:18:23 <fizzie> I haven't been retraining any of the styles because of the complex ethical questions it involves.
2020-08-26 00:19:10 <int-e> Does that include GDPR?
2020-08-26 00:19:50 <fizzie> I don't think that counts as "ethical", but it's certainly complex, a question, and probably involved if you think too long about it.
2020-08-26 00:20:07 <int-e> Ah, that's borderline tautological.
2020-08-26 00:20:20 <int-e> And it becomes more tautological the more you think about it ;-)
