2020-11-01 00:13:55 <delta23> so, i've been thinking
2020-11-01 00:14:03 <delta23> if there was a variant of brainfuck with only
2020-11-01 00:14:08 <delta23> <>+-
2020-11-01 00:14:19 <delta23> but with the difference that programs could be infinitely long
2020-11-01 00:14:33 <delta23> would that make it turing complete?

2020-11-01 00:16:56 <Arcorann> Doubtful, since you've removed all the commands that depend on the state of memory
2020-11-01 00:17:45 <delta23> shouldn't it be possible to implement conditionals based on these? the program would be really large if possible..
2020-11-01 00:17:59 <Arcorann> Conditioning on what?
2020-11-01 00:18:32 <delta23> ie simulating a turing machine using the above and simulating conditional flow
2020-11-01 00:19:30 <Arcorann> Question still stands: what would the conditionals depend on
2020-11-01 00:19:49 <delta23> i'm not sure
2020-11-01 00:20:20 <delta23> i've been trying to figure out if it's possible to do that without looping/explicit conditionals
2020-11-01 00:25:21 <delta23> i know that the above instructions are at least as powerful as a linear bounded automata if said infinite program repeats infinitely(ie within a infinite loop)
