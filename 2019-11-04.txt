2019-11-04 00:00:41 <imode> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_calculus this is interesting.
2019-11-04 00:01:39 <kmc> i don't like this syntax
2019-11-04 00:01:48 <imode> which one, ambient or pi.
2019-11-04 00:01:55 <imode> I like neither.
2019-11-04 00:02:33 <kmc> pi
2019-11-04 00:02:59 <imode> I feel like the unrestricted use of channels is a problem.
2019-11-04 00:03:07 <imode> no one man needs all those channels.
2019-11-04 00:03:32 <kmc> 800 channels and nothing on...
2019-11-04 00:04:33 <imode> T in Mode would be { receive receive receive roll drop last send }, while F in mode would be { receive receive receive roll roll drop last last send }
2019-11-04 00:06:22 <kmc> i don't know this language, how does it work
2019-11-04 00:06:28 <kmc> is it a stack based concurrent calculus?
2019-11-04 00:06:55 <imode> close. queue based.
2019-11-04 00:07:07 <kmc> ok
2019-11-04 00:08:06 <imode> each process (the stuff between { and }s) gets allocated a single channel. `receive` always references that channel.
2019-11-04 00:08:47 <imode> `send`, though, references any channel at the head of the queue, and sends the value after that channel through it.

2019-11-04 00:08:54 <imode> sorry.
2019-11-04 00:10:06 <imode> I have stuff like looping constructs, but I wonder if I can render them obsolete by treating { and } as looping processes with a halt operation.
2019-11-04 00:12:15 <imode> one sec..

2019-11-04 00:15:42 <imode> forking a process for every loop could be.. useful, I suppose.
2019-11-04 00:22:19 <imode> an if construct would be @{VVV:..$^}{VVV:..$^}^^^ sans some shuffling ops.
2019-11-04 00:22:31 <imode> it's just @ true true send send send
2019-11-04 00:28:02 <pikhq> I feel like that'd be relatively easy to build on top of BEAM.
