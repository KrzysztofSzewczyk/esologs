2019-11-15 00:12:19 <tswett> So, I'm playing with Attempto Controlled English, which is (mostly) a syntax for first-order logic.
2019-11-15 00:12:58 <tswett> There's an ACE theorem prover here: http://attempto.ifi.uzh.ch/race/
2019-11-15 00:13:28 <tswett> I've found that it's able to prove a certain rather interesting theorem.
2019-11-15 00:13:48 <tswett> Axioms: David is a person. If there is a person A then exactly one person is a mother of the person A.
2019-11-15 00:14:02 <tswett> Theorem (apparently): Every person is a mother of David.
2019-11-15 00:15:25 <tswett> Corollary: David is a mother of David.
2019-11-15 00:16:46 <tswett> I'm trying to figure out how it managed to conclude that...
2019-11-15 00:18:52 <b_jonas> tswett: can it also prove that every person is David?
2019-11-15 00:19:51 <tswett> b_jonas: Hmmm, yes, it can.

2019-11-15 00:20:56 <b_jonas> tswett: can it still prove that if you only take the first axiom?
2019-11-15 00:21:28 <tswett> b_jonas: No.
2019-11-15 00:21:46 <b_jonas> tswett: how about if you take the first axiom, and the second axiom but replace "A" with "X" case sensitively
2019-11-15 00:22:14 <b_jonas> (as in, maybe it confuses "a" with "A" which is why it misunderstands something)
2019-11-15 00:22:31 <tswett> It still proves that every person is David.
2019-11-15 00:22:55 <tswett> So now I haveâ€”
2019-11-15 00:23:05 <b_jonas> Do you have the source code for the prover?
2019-11-15 00:23:21 <tswett> Axioms: David is a person. If there is a person X then exactly one person is a mother of the person X. Theorem: Every person is David.
2019-11-15 00:23:21 <b_jonas> Can it prove a contradiction from those axioms?
2019-11-15 00:23:50 <tswett> It says the axioms are consistent.
2019-11-15 00:24:37 <b_jonas> Can you formalize the theorem prover into that lanuage, and if so, can it prove the formal version of "the ACE theorem prover cannot prove this statement"?
2019-11-15 00:24:50 <tswett> Oof.
2019-11-15 00:25:00 <b_jonas> Sorry.
2019-11-15 00:25:05 <b_jonas> That wasn't a serious question.
2019-11-15 00:25:05 <tswett> :D
2019-11-15 00:25:19 <b_jonas> Anyway, does this theorem prover output proofs?
2019-11-15 00:25:40 <tswett> No, only minimal subsets of axioms required to prove the theorem.
2019-11-15 00:26:44 <b_jonas> tswett: are you sure that that second axiom has a quantifier over X?
2019-11-15 00:27:38 <shachaf> Am I David?
2019-11-15 00:29:25 <tswett> b_jonas: It definitely interprets X as a bound variable.
2019-11-15 00:29:38 <tswett> In both positions.

2019-11-15 00:30:17 <tswett> Ahøyrjan.
2019-11-15 00:30:55 <tswett> The axioms don't prove "Everything is David." but they do prove "Everyone is David."
2019-11-15 00:32:16 <tswett> They also prove "Every house is a person," and, of course, "Every house is David."

2019-11-15 00:32:17 <oerjan> tswellot. sounds like sound axioms.
2019-11-15 00:35:41 <tswett> Also, "Someone is everything."

2019-11-15 00:47:31 <tswett> Hmmmm. I think it's doing something weird with proper names.
2019-11-15 00:47:42 <tswett> Axioms: David is a person. Brian is a cat.
2019-11-15 00:47:47 <tswett> Theorem: David is a cat.
2019-11-15 00:57:25 <tswett> Sole axiom: David is a person and a person is David.
2019-11-15 00:57:31 <tswett> Theorem: Every house is a person.
