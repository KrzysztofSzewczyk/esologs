2020-10-18 00:02:46 <b_jonas> zzo38: yes, but where's the rule that says you can't cast a land?
2020-10-18 00:03:02 <b_jonas> it looks like there's none, though this may get fixed in the next update
2020-10-18 00:08:53 <zzo38> Rule 305.9 says a land that is also another type can't be cast as a spell, but that doesn't say if it is only one. That seems to be a mistake, but I suppose that for now, it would seem to be allowed even if it isn't supposed to be allowed.

2020-10-18 00:19:18 <ais523> if you have a card with no types, can you cast it?
2020-10-18 00:19:27 <ais523> (assuming it's in your hand and has a mana cost)
2020-10-18 00:20:34 <ais523> bear in mind that I'm not convinced the situation can ever arise, but the situation of casting a land on the back of an MDFC seems comparable (except that it doesn't have a mana cost, so you'd need Omniscience or the like)
2020-10-18 00:23:17 <zzo38> I don't know.
2020-10-18 00:25:53 <b_jonas> ais523: I don't think there's a way to have a card with no types outside the battlefield
2020-10-18 00:26:52 <b_jonas> but the rules are weird about that, if you could get to cast such a thing, it would not enter the battlefield, because it wouldn't count as a permanent spell, it would try to resolve like a sorcery but not quite count as a sorcery in all respects
2020-10-18 00:27:45 <b_jonas> ais523: but I don't think there's anything to stop you from casting it from your hand if it has a mana cost
2020-10-18 00:28:02 <zzo38> The rules say a object with instant or sorcery type cannot enter the battlefield, but I don't know about other ones
2020-10-18 00:28:57 <b_jonas> hmm wait
2020-10-18 00:29:01 <b_jonas> I don't know what would happen
