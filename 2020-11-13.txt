2020-11-13 00:16:26 <zzo38> If you are making hashcash, I think that the padding of SHA1 only needs to be implemented once unless the length changes, and maybe some other stuff too I don't know. Since, it requires calculating the hash many times until enough first few bits are all zero.
2020-11-13 00:18:03 <zzo38> (I also had a idea of a variant, which uses "timestamp:version:resource:bits:random", where the timestamp is preceded by its length, and there is no counter field (it is not needed since the random field can be used). It uses only base36 and base64, and a line feed must be appended when calculating the hash.
