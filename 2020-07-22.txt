2020-07-22 00:07:25 <salpynx> Thanks HackEso! You just helped me troubleshoot a work-related problem involving UTF-8 encoded Tamil and binary MARC (1960s binary format for library) records. Sharing because that's pretty esoteric, and surprising since joining #esoteric was more for procrastination than getting things done.

2020-07-22 00:10:16 <zzo38> I cleaned the computer; that seemed to to reduce the CPU temperature by 7 kelvin, although the motherboard temperature and graphics temperature seem to be the same as before. The room temperature seems to have increased, although that might be due to something else. (The room temperature as measured by a red temperature)
2020-07-22 00:10:22 <salpynx> FTR, no Unicode was incorrectly encoded, I needed confirmation I was locating utf8 byte strings within a binary format correctly. The problem was not because of Unicode :)
2020-07-22 00:16:55 <salpynx> Room-temperature computing is a worthwhile goal. Definitely harder for some computers.
2020-07-22 00:23:16 <zzo38> Is it expected that the mother board temperature should match the room temperature?
