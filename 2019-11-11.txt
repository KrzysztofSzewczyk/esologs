2019-11-11 01:40:14 <moony> Answer: no
2019-11-11 01:40:43 <shachaf> How does two watched literals work with backtracking?
2019-11-11 01:41:38 <shachaf> The thing I imagine doing for 2WL is: You have a queue of literals that are forced to true. When you do unit propagation, you find new literals that are in unit clauses, and push them onto your queue.
2019-11-11 01:42:05 <shachaf> But when you backtrack, do you just discard part of your queue depending on the backtrack level? I don't think that's what people do.
2019-11-11 01:42:15 <int-e> queue?!
2019-11-11 01:42:21 <shachaf> Not a queue?
2019-11-11 01:42:31 <int-e> I don't see a queue.
2019-11-11 01:42:56 <shachaf> You think you just set the literals to true directly?
2019-11-11 01:43:14 <shachaf> I feel like you must have a queue or a stack or something.
2019-11-11 01:43:26 <moony> Also, i've been considering setting up my own mediawiki wiki for general CS
2019-11-11 01:43:33 <moony> things
2019-11-11 01:43:44 <moony> (Damn you enter key I wasn't done)
2019-11-11 01:44:05 <int-e> shachaf: The trail is a stack to me. But it's not immediately connected to the watched literals.
2019-11-11 01:44:15 <shachaf> The trail is just the regular stack, that's not what I mean.
2019-11-11 01:44:32 <int-e> I see no queues in 2WL at all.
2019-11-11 01:45:13 <shachaf> Say you're in some state where you have the clauses (x | y) & (x | z)
2019-11-11 01:45:45 <shachaf> You end up with ¨x. Now you have to infer y and z. Right?
2019-11-11 01:45:57 <int-e> Oh, that's where the queue is.
2019-11-11 01:46:04 <shachaf> Then you need to find all the clauses that have ¨y and ¨z as their watched literals.
2019-11-11 01:46:09 <int-e> Yeah, fair enough.
2019-11-11 01:47:11 <int-e> And yes, I expect you discard the queue when you find a conflict. You don't touch the 2WL lists either; you have to ensure that every (non-unit) clause is on two lists as you process the literals.
2019-11-11 01:47:28 <Sgeo> I was wrong, VRML is not dead: http://create3000.de/x_ite/getting-started/
2019-11-11 01:47:40 <shachaf> I know you don't need to undo 2WL when you backtrack, which is a neat trick.
2019-11-11 01:47:47 <shachaf> But do you just discard the entire queue?
2019-11-11 01:47:55 <int-e> sure
2019-11-11 01:48:08 <int-e> you've found a conflict... you don't need more
2019-11-11 01:49:54 <shachaf> Let me see. Say you have the clause (¨y | x)...
2019-11-11 01:49:55 <shachaf> Oh, I see.
2019-11-11 01:50:06 <int-e> (I expect you could keep going in hope of finding a nicer conflict clause? But the moment you find a conflict you violate the 2WL invariant that watched literals are not on the trail...)
2019-11-11 01:50:24 <shachaf> You can just scrap the whole queue because this was all the propagation step, and the conflict was implied by the initial choice of ¨x.
2019-11-11 01:50:48 <shachaf> There are no decisions made while the queue is nonempty, of course.
2019-11-11 01:51:42 <int-e> (Which probably doesn't matter, but you probably need to be careful not to put a literal and its complement on the trail, at which point conflicts become very much meaningless. It seems messy.)
2019-11-11 01:52:18 <int-e> You'll still want to keep the processed literals for conflict analysis.
2019-11-11 01:52:36 <shachaf> I started implementing this queue as some kind of circular buffer thing but then I saw what minisat does:
2019-11-11 01:52:47 <shachaf> They just store the queue on the trail itself, right after all the literals in the trail.
2019-11-11 01:53:07 <shachaf> Then they just adjust the trail end index forward as they pop things off the queue onto the trail.
2019-11-11 01:53:12 <shachaf> So much better.
2019-11-11 01:53:37 <int-e> Sgeo__: I'm afraid that things don't die anymore... they go out of fashion but linger on. People will just build compatibility layers like the one you linked to.
2019-11-11 01:54:28 <int-e> shachaf: Of course that is where you put the queue... which is why I didn't see it at first.
2019-11-11 01:54:46 <shachaf> Right, it's really just the unprocessed part of the trail.
2019-11-11 01:54:53 <Sgeo> Technically it's not implementing the VRML spec faithfully. There's also an X3D spec that's a next version VRML, that's still being worked on.
2019-11-11 01:55:01 <shachaf> But I didn't think of it that way at first!
2019-11-11 01:55:08 <Sgeo> https://github.com/create3000/x_ite/issues/50
2019-11-11 01:56:18 <int-e> Sgeo__: you seem to care a lot about VRML
2019-11-11 01:56:46 <Sgeo> I spent some of my childhood in Cybertown, which used VRML, and before then I read a book about VRML

2019-11-11 01:59:44 <HackEso> A matrix is just a matrix. People use them to communicate. Taneb invented them.
2019-11-11 02:02:58 <shachaf> So the better way to think of this is that some suffix of the trail is "unpropagated" and still needs to be processed.

2019-11-11 04:03:23 <int-e> BTC is cute and small in comparison. Oh and I can lightly treat it as a joke because I'm not invested in it. You can identify the role and interests of individuals. Bobby Lee, for example, is co-founder and CEO of BTCC, a chinese bitcoin exchange. So predicting a bright future for BTC is in his interest.

2019-11-11 18:57:46 <b_jonas> int-e: yes, the ones that shift in bit units shift only within words (that are 16, 32, or 64 bit wide); the ones that shift in byte units shift the entire 128-bit register; the latter is mostly obsolete because we just use full permute instructions now, either way is just as slow; the former are also partly obsolete as we now have variable shift instructions that shift each word by a different amount as
2019-11-11 18:57:52 <b_jonas> given by the words of another register
2019-11-11 18:58:17 <b_jonas> there certainly are some overlap in the usage of these, but they are different enough instructions
2019-11-11 18:58:24 <b_jonas> that they're all called "shift" is a pity

2019-11-11 19:30:49 <arseniiv> hey hey suppose we have a finite digraph (possibly with self-loops) and we start with I[0] the set of all sink vertices, then each time we set I[n+1] := I[n] ‚à™ (all vertices with outcoming edges only to vertices of I[n]). When I[n] settles (the graph is finite), what do we get? I suspect this set has a nice name
2019-11-11 19:33:04 <arseniiv> (though as I[n] ‚äÇ I[n+1], we can take even an infinite graph and just take a limit of I afterwards, maybe of an ordinal-valued sequence)
2019-11-11 19:33:43 <arseniiv> hm it reminds me induction
2019-11-11 19:34:10 <arseniiv> (I swear I didn‚Äôt name I after ‚Äúinduction‚Äù)
2019-11-11 19:38:14 <b_jonas> arseniiv: I don't think you get anything particularly interesting or nice
2019-11-11 19:39:41 <arseniiv> this occurs when I try to decide if an algebraic type is inhabited; the vertices are types and t ‚Üí u when a value of u is absolutely needed to construct a value of t
2019-11-11 19:39:43 <b_jonas> arseniiv: there's a decomposition theorem for digraphs, where the digraph is made of strongly connected components aka strong components, any two node in the same strong component are reachable from each other both ways, and no two strong component is reachable from each other both ways,
2019-11-11 19:39:55 <b_jonas> so if you contract the strong component, you get a digraph without a loop
2019-11-11 19:40:37 <b_jonas> in your case, you start from sink vertices, which are exactly the sink strong components that have only one node, and then take all nodes (or all strong components) reachable from those backwards
2019-11-11 19:40:48 <b_jonas> hmm wait, that's not what you said
2019-11-11 19:40:59 <b_jonas> sorry, wait a moment
2019-11-11 19:41:06 <arseniiv> yeah, that‚Äôs more peculiar :)
2019-11-11 19:41:11 <b_jonas> "I[n+1] := I[n] ‚à™ (all vertices with outcoming edges only to vertices of I[n])"
2019-11-11 19:41:35 <arseniiv> for a vertex v to be added, we need that for all v ‚Üí w, w be in I[n]
2019-11-11 19:41:41 <b_jonas> yes, that's fewer nodes
2019-11-11 19:42:35 <b_jonas> the set of nodes you get in the end won't even have directed loops among them
2019-11-11 19:43:20 <arseniiv> (my hypothesis that lim I consists precisely of all inhabited types, for the semantics given above)
2019-11-11 19:44:13 <b_jonas> arseniiv: no way
2019-11-11 19:45:15 <arseniiv> at least it should be a necessary condition?
2019-11-11 19:45:24 <b_jonas> arseniiv: consider data R where { {- uninhabited -} }; data S where { {- uninhabited -} }; data A = P R | Q S;
2019-11-11 19:45:38 <b_jonas> neither R nor S is absolutely needed to construct A, and yet A is uninhabited
2019-11-11 19:45:53 <arseniiv> b_jonas: ah, now I remember, thanks!
2019-11-11 19:46:01 <arseniiv> I considered that but forgot
2019-11-11 19:46:13 <arseniiv> now I think maybe I need to work constructor-wise
2019-11-11 19:48:06 <arseniiv> I‚Äôll write if I succeed on this way
2019-11-11 19:55:22 <b_jonas> arseniiv: how many type system extensions do you have? is this still plain algebraic types, or do you have type parameters or even more?
2019-11-11 19:55:55 <arseniiv> b_jonas: plain ones, no parameters
2019-11-11 19:56:09 <b_jonas> I believe if you have just plain algebraic types, then you can find out precisely which types are inhabited
2019-11-11 19:56:33 <b_jonas> if you add enough type system extensions, eventually your compile time becomes Turing-complete, and then or before, you can only prove some of your uninhabited types uninhabited
2019-11-11 19:56:49 <b_jonas> that's still useful for optimizations, and it's not usually a problem that you can't prove an uninhabited type uninhabited, mind you
2019-11-11 19:57:00 <b_jonas> so it's still worth to have basic checks for that in a compiler
2019-11-11 19:57:16 <arseniiv> you may even remember when I talked to myself here about proving generalized Minsky machines TC for exactly those type definitions which give us infinitely many values
2019-11-11 19:58:15 <arseniiv> b_jonas: yeah, I agree with what you said too
2019-11-11 19:58:30 <b_jonas> arseniiv: that sounds plausible, because those types can simulate natural numbers, and counter machines with enough registers are turing-complete,
2019-11-11 19:58:46 <b_jonas> whereas if you only have types that have finitely many values, then your state space is finite
2019-11-11 19:59:18 <arseniiv> now I have sat and written a proof that indeed infinitude of values is equivalent to TCness, but now I want an icing on a cake showing how to decide if there are infinite values syntactically
2019-11-11 19:59:43 <b_jonas> high chance of rain tomorrow, says the weather prediction. ok.
2019-11-11 19:59:48 <arseniiv> yeah, precisely what I written out
2019-11-11 19:59:55 <arseniiv> (not about the rain)
