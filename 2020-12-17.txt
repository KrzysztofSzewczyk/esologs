2020-12-17 01:43:18 <fizzie> Hmm, is this a cfunge bug, or am I just misinterpreting something.
2020-12-17 01:44:04 <fizzie> Unless I'm mistaken, its & instruction is, given the input "0\n", also consuming the newline from the input, which I think it shouldn't do.
2020-12-17 01:46:44 <fizzie> https://github.com/VorpalBlade/cfunge/blob/master/src/input.c#L167 I guess that's an intentional choice, but I don't think that's how it should work.
2020-12-17 01:47:06 <fizzie> "Decimal input reads and discards characters until it encounters decimal digit characters, at which point it reads a decimal number from those digits, up until (but not including) the point at which input characters stop being digits, or the point where the next digit would cause a cell overflow, whichever comes first." No special rules about newlines.

2020-12-17 02:33:53 <oren> or why it doesn't give any error
2020-12-17 02:39:24 <oren> did GCC implement closures, but only one level of nesting or  some shit?
2020-12-17 02:44:55 <shachaf> what is this bizarro code tdnh
2020-12-17 02:45:49 <shachaf> The C syntax for this thing is so hard to read when you don't use typedefs.
2020-12-17 02:46:49 <oren> it's a uhh (int) -> (int) -> (int) -> struct rectprism
2020-12-17 02:48:10 <shachaf> I see.
2020-12-17 02:57:18 <oren> tcc and clang reject this
2020-12-17 02:57:36 <shachaf> Right, nested functions are a GNU extension.
2020-12-17 02:58:01 <shachaf> OK, I'm looking at the code now and I certainly wouldn't expect this to work.
2020-12-17 02:58:12 <shachaf> f is only valid inside some_func.
2020-12-17 02:58:33 <shachaf> You can't just return it and have the closure work anywhere.
2020-12-17 02:59:06 <shachaf> The closure has a pointer into some_func's stack frame.
2020-12-17 03:01:53 <nakilon> I think about making ~ and & also "work as trampoline or not" on EOF instead of reversing
2020-12-17 03:16:52 <nakilon> fizzie btw my unfinished befunge-98 implementation has a bug around that -- it eats one char after integer
2020-12-17 03:18:04 <nakilon> I fixed it in RASEL -- good thing Ruby provides ungetbyte method to push bytes back to the stream ..D

2020-12-17 04:18:01 <b_jonas> nakilon: I like the idea that ? now jumps forward one or two cells. this way you can write arbitrary control flow in one dimensional code by like pushing a number then ?j
2020-12-17 04:19:09 <b_jonas> well, more like pushing a distance, then pushing the tested number, then ?j
2020-12-17 04:36:58 <nakilon> the reversing ? kind of allowed that too, but yeah, it's good to keep the pointer going the same direction
2020-12-17 04:50:38 <b_jonas> nakilon: hmm, that's true, though then you basically need a trampoline
2020-12-17 04:51:23 <b_jonas> and I guess I should say ?j$ so it discards the jump length if the branch isn't taken
2020-12-17 05:00:41 <b_jonas> anyway, I think RASEL can indeed simulate an arbitrary finite control machine with single queue of finite alphabet. represent the alphabet with small natural numbers. if a symbol is on the top of the stack, you can do a big case distinction on it like >:?v1-:?v1-:?v1-:?v1-?v> . between states of the original machine, the stack shall contain the queue and then the length of the queue plus one over it. to
2020-12-17 05:00:47 <b_jonas> push a symbol A, you can just >A\1+> . to shift a symbol and test it, you do like >:a :?v1-:?v1-:?v1-:?v1-?v>
2020-12-17 05:00:55 <b_jonas> and to initialize an empty queue, just >1>
2020-12-17 05:01:04 <b_jonas> so you don't in fact need bigints
2020-12-17 05:03:00 <b_jonas> and this still works in single-line code, you just have to you just do L\?j$ to put the jump distance L under the number tested
2020-12-17 05:05:17 <b_jonas> but it's still not clear to me if you can do an arbitrary computation in RASEL without leaving junk on the stack forever
2020-12-17 05:06:33 <b_jonas> all the constructions I mentioned, both this one with a queue, and the one with integer registers (and, as a special case, blindfolded artithmetic, or state machine with a fixed number of stacks of finite alphabets) do leave junk on the stack.
2020-12-17 05:10:31 <b_jonas> if you added a second memory (outside the stack) with random access load, store, and sbrk instructions, that would of course solve all the problems and make this something to which you can compile normal programs with a random-access memory.
2020-12-17 05:11:15 <b_jonas> you could use the bottom of that extra memory as registers that you can load and store conveniently, which lets you rearrange the top of the stack
2020-12-17 05:11:24 <b_jonas> and you could use the rest as just read-writable memory
2020-12-17 05:12:04 <b_jonas> but that perhaps would be a different or less esoteric language.
2020-12-17 05:12:49 <b_jonas> one that's more suitable for golfing at least though

2020-12-17 06:16:36 <int-e> right
2020-12-17 06:16:37 <shachaf> And I've been wondering why. I guess this it why.
2020-12-17 06:18:00 <int-e> and it's a great twist because it gives you a pretty different flavor of puzzles
2020-12-17 06:18:20 <shachaf> This puzzle didn't even use it.
2020-12-17 06:18:57 <int-e> Yeah, they are doing a good job of introduces the mechanic first as an accident, then make use of it in later puzzles
2020-12-17 06:19:04 <b_jonas> shachaf: do you mean "step onto" or "stop on"?
2020-12-17 06:19:16 <int-e> b_jonas: the former

2020-12-17 06:28:49 <shachaf> I'm not sure what distinction you're making.
2020-12-17 06:29:12 <shachaf> Short rocks are elevated, and if you're also elevated, you can step onto them.
2020-12-17 06:34:36 <int-e> shachaf: you made a typo
2020-12-17 06:34:53 <shachaf> Oh, now I see it.
2020-12-17 07:00:31 <shachaf> Now I'm puzzled by 303,102
2020-12-17 07:03:26 <int-e> let me guess, it's another puzzle
2020-12-17 07:06:02 <shachaf> There's a tall tree, a short tree, and a short rock, if that clears it up.
2020-12-17 07:08:21 <int-e> sounds like every 6th island :)
2020-12-17 07:09:10 <int-e> (I'd have to start up the game and I'm refusing this time)
2020-12-17 07:09:49 <shachaf> Oh no, I didn't mean to make you start up the game.
2020-12-17 07:10:00 <shachaf> I thought you had it up already before, since you said 139 landmarks.
2020-12-17 07:10:40 <int-e> and then I quit
2020-12-17 07:11:10 <int-e> the main issue I have is that they made finding islands really inconvenient
2020-12-17 07:11:35 <int-e> even navigating by coordinates is a process of trial and error
2020-12-17 07:12:00 <shachaf> It's https://slbkbs.org/tmp/2020-12-16-231107_3840x2160.png if you're curious
2020-12-17 07:13:16 <int-e> ah, yeah, that one looks fun
2020-12-17 07:15:58 <int-e> 50 moves or so :)
2020-12-17 07:18:09 <shachaf> Oh, wait, this was so easy.
2020-12-17 07:18:13 <shachaf> I was so close the whole time.
2020-12-17 07:18:39 <int-e> I should set up a proxy for myself that resizes images
2020-12-17 07:19:52 <shachaf> I could presize them.
2020-12-17 07:20:03 <shachaf> Why do you want them smaller?
2020-12-17 07:20:22 <int-e> because the 3MB download takes noticable time for me

2020-12-17 07:20:52 <shachaf> Aha.
2020-12-17 07:21:18 <shachaf> Too bad every web page has 3MB of JavaScript these days.
2020-12-17 07:21:19 <int-e> and all the information is still perfectly visible at 25% of the size
2020-12-17 07:21:28 <int-e> I also disable JS.
2020-12-17 07:21:34 <int-e> Almost everywhere.
2020-12-17 07:21:35 <shachaf> It's being upscaled from 1920x1080 anyway.
2020-12-17 07:22:00 <shachaf> Did you know that in JavaScript, "for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) { BODY }" is different from "{ let i; for (i = 0; i < n; i++) { BODY } }"?
2020-12-17 07:22:07 <zzo38> Not all web pages have 3MB of JavaScript; some have less, and a few have none at all.
2020-12-17 07:23:45 <int-e> zzo38: oh really I didn't know
2020-12-17 07:24:04 <shachaf> zzo38: Some also have more.
2020-12-17 07:24:37 <zzo38> Yes, some have more. I don't know how much is the average
2020-12-17 07:26:18 <zzo38> I would try to avoid it by promoting the use of plain text, simple HTML (when plain text won't do), NNTP, Gopher, simpler VMs in case you need one anyways, etc
2020-12-17 07:27:59 <shachaf> zzo38: But I want my traffic to be encryptd. I don't think Gopher supports that.
2020-12-17 07:29:25 <zzo38> You could use Gopher or any other protocol with TLS, I suppose, but I don't know which implementations will do that. Gemini supports encryption, though.
2020-12-17 07:30:07 <zzo38> Of course HTTP is still useful too, but there are too many complicated things and stupid things that should be avoided hopefully even when doing so

2020-12-17 09:57:41 <nakilon> and yeah, not only that could be in JPEG, the game state is actually 5x5 cells

2020-12-17 09:59:14 <int-e> BMP is to micro-softy
2020-12-17 09:59:26 <nakilon> why do you make private youtube browsing sessions?
2020-12-17 09:59:32 <nakilon> there is nothing illegal on youtube
2020-12-17 10:00:21 <shachaf> Is BMP Microsofty?

2020-12-17 10:02:42 <int-e> Or even Windows 2.0 but who ever even used that...
2020-12-17 10:02:46 <shachaf> Sure, that's the origin of the format, but the format itself?
2020-12-17 10:02:57 <int-e> It was used heavily in OS/2 as well.
2020-12-17 10:03:08 <shachaf> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/BMPfileFormat.png
2020-12-17 10:03:23 <int-e> I still only see BMP files in Windows.
2020-12-17 10:04:33 <int-e> In practice most of the pictures I have are PNG and JPEG anyway.
2020-12-17 10:04:56 <int-e> And it makes very much sense for screenshots to default to PNG.
2020-12-17 10:05:50 <shachaf> Presumably people could do way better than JPEG nowadays for lossy image compression?
2020-12-17 10:06:06 <int-e> They can.
2020-12-17 10:07:36 <int-e> There's JPEG2000 which is burdened by patents... I suppose webp is the latest attempt to overcome JPEG?
2020-12-17 10:08:11 <nakilon> it does not make sense to screenshot games in png
2020-12-17 10:08:53 <nakilon> most of the games use jpeg by default in their built-in screenshoting feature
2020-12-17 10:09:02 <nakilon> because they realise this thing
2020-12-17 10:11:08 <nakilon> unfortunately unlike jpeg the webp is being changed everyday -- they patch the format and the CLI webp converter tools become incompatible even with Google Chrome
2020-12-17 10:17:18 <shachaf> I didn't use a built-in screenshotting feature.
2020-12-17 10:17:37 <shachaf> I just have one screenshot button, and it shoots the exact pixels that are on screen.
2020-12-17 10:17:41 <shachaf> Why would I have more than that?
2020-12-17 10:18:05 <nakilon> jpeg does not mean it takes another number of pixels

2020-12-17 10:19:51 <int-e> jpeg is not a good default for screenshots
2020-12-17 10:20:18 <nakilon> it is
2020-12-17 10:21:36 <nakilon> that's why Steam makes screenshots in jpeg too
2020-12-17 10:21:41 <int-e> screenshots should be lossless by default, to preserve small details and text
2020-12-17 10:21:45 <nakilon> I guess
2020-12-17 10:22:12 <nakilon> games don't have small details and text
2020-12-17 10:22:18 <nakilon> they are games

2020-12-17 10:22:28 <FireFly> depending on the game

2020-12-17 10:22:41 <nakilon> this makes no sense
2020-12-17 10:22:58 <FireFly> I believe a fairly large fraction of games contain dialogue
2020-12-17 10:23:04 <int-e> there are many games that feature lots of text
2020-12-17 10:23:22 <nakilon> 13:08:10 <nakilon> it does not make sense to screenshot games in png
2020-12-17 10:23:38 <nakilon> where did I say here that it makes no sense to screenshot small details and text in png?
2020-12-17 10:23:41 <nakilon> games != irc
2020-12-17 10:23:48 <nakilon> games != websites
2020-12-17 10:23:51 <int-e> now if the only games you play are fast-paced games rendered with a 3D engine you're probably right
2020-12-17 10:23:52 <Taneb> Games often have small details and text
2020-12-17 10:23:53 <nakilon> games != terminal logs
2020-12-17 10:24:05 <FireFly> many games have small details and text
2020-12-17 10:24:19 <FireFly> where you probably want crisp screenshots :p
2020-12-17 10:24:34 <FireFly> doesn't really matter though
2020-12-17 10:24:42 <Taneb> A lot of games also have large regions of flat colours, which I believe is very suitable for PNG
2020-12-17 10:24:45 <FireFly> would make sense to have it be a setting I guess
2020-12-17 10:24:50 <nakilon> "there are many games that" does not negate the fact that most of the games don't have it
2020-12-17 10:24:53 <nakilon> there is no logic
2020-12-17 10:24:55 <int-e> Besides, even for 3D games I'd prefer lossless screenshots; I can always compress them myself later.
2020-12-17 10:24:57 <Taneb> Most of the games I play do
2020-12-17 10:25:24 <Taneb> Why do you care what other people use to take screenshots of things to show to still other people?
2020-12-17 10:25:28 <nakilon> guys, I guess you just were never really making screenshots
2020-12-17 10:25:59 <nakilon> and don't realise that even if the game has 75% of screen scape of one flat color it still does not make png screenshot smaller
2020-12-17 10:26:11 <nakilon> *75% of screen space

2020-12-17 10:26:46 <Taneb> Again, why do you care
2020-12-17 10:27:10 <nakilon> because in fact the screenshots you were sharing today were not from TIS, they were from the average game
2020-12-17 10:27:11 <FireFly> hum
2020-12-17 10:27:15 <int-e> Regardless, we were discussing a default of builtin OS functionality, and there's simply no argument to be made for using JPEG in that context.
2020-12-17 10:27:18 <nakilon> and it was 3mb while could be 300kb
2020-12-17 10:27:34 <FireFly> this also depends on the lossiness of the jpeg, no?
2020-12-17 10:27:50 <nakilon> default OS functionality has nothing to do with png, it takes shots in bmp
2020-12-17 10:28:08 <FireFly> maybe I'm missing some context here, idk
2020-12-17 10:28:25 <Taneb> nakilon: that depends on which OS you're using. Many of us do not use Windows
2020-12-17 10:28:27 <shachaf> Who said anything about the number of pixels? I care about the content of the pixels.
2020-12-17 10:28:40 <nakilon> it's the job of additional software to convert the clipboard to png or jpeg and you usually have a choice that you may want to do carefully
2020-12-17 10:28:41 <shachaf> I only have one screenshot button. I don't really want a different kind of screenshot for games.
2020-12-17 10:28:53 <Taneb> Screenshots on my computer take PNG by default
2020-12-17 10:29:15 <nakilon> Taneb pretty sure every OS stores clipboard as bitmap
2020-12-17 10:29:46 <Taneb> If I press my print screen button, it saves a PNG in my Pictures directory.
2020-12-17 10:29:53 <Taneb> I have done no configuration to set this up
2020-12-17 10:29:54 <nakilon> guys, you confuse all the things with each other
2020-12-17 10:30:04 <nakilon> computer, keyboard, software, clipboard
2020-12-17 10:30:12 <Taneb> This is the default on my OS and desktop environment
2020-12-17 10:30:34 <Taneb> I still don't know why you care so much about this
2020-12-17 10:30:40 <shachaf> You're the one bringing all these things up. I have no clipboard. Screenshots get saved into the screenshot directory.
2020-12-17 10:30:43 <FireFly> looking at the screenshots I've apparently taken in steam, I think I'm happier with all four as png's than jpg's :p

2020-12-17 10:30:54 <shachaf> I set up my own screenshot thing which is better than the system I've seen in any OS by default.
2020-12-17 10:31:24 <shachaf> You press Print Screen, and it shows a little modal menu at the top of the screen, and then you press w to screenshot a window, r to screenshot the whole screen, or s to select a region.
2020-12-17 10:31:43 <shachaf> Instead of memorizing Alt+PrtScr or Cmd+Shift+5 or some nonsense like that.
2020-12-17 10:32:29 <FireFly> neat
2020-12-17 10:32:32 <nakilon> so the thing is that you just don't care how your tools are configured
2020-12-17 10:32:42 <Taneb> shachaf clearly cares
2020-12-17 10:32:51 <Taneb> I don't know why you care about how I take screenshots
2020-12-17 10:33:07 <nakilon> and in result you throw screenshots that weight 3mb and have only 25 bytes of meaningfull data in it
2020-12-17 10:33:09 <Taneb> Perhaps the thing you care about is starting arguments?
2020-12-17 10:33:18 <int-e> I have a question... what's a clipboard :P
2020-12-17 10:33:29 <int-e> I know about active selections
2020-12-17 10:33:37 <nakilon> if there was no problem in it there would be no message in this chat: "hey, why your screenshot is 3mb" -- it was not me who said that
2020-12-17 10:33:51 <shachaf> int-e: It's one of the X11 selections.
2020-12-17 10:33:55 <nakilon> so you are suffering from your own unwilling to learn about image formats
2020-12-17 10:34:01 <shachaf> PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD are the two standard ones.
2020-12-17 10:34:11 <int-e> (sadly X11 *does* have a clipboard mechanism, and I always have to jump through hoops to work with software that uses it)
2020-12-17 10:34:23 <shachaf> What is it about image formats that I haven't learned that you're saying I need to learn?
2020-12-17 10:34:51 <shachaf> I think the real problem is that my screenshot was only 3 millibits, and that's not nearly enough information.
2020-12-17 10:35:57 <shachaf> I uploaded a 3 MB screenshot because the thing I want by default -- when I don't think about it -- is a lossless reproduction of my screen. When I think about it I can switch to something else.
2020-12-17 10:36:04 <shachaf> Why am I getting into this again?
2020-12-17 10:36:12 <int-e> nakilon: I may have complained about the size, but I still consider that to be *my* problem, not shachaf's.

2020-12-17 10:42:51 <nakilon> one of you is sharing a screenshot in not suitable format, another one highlights the problem and when I come to help solving it I get "stop arguing" themed responses
2020-12-17 10:43:09 <arseniiv> I too am confused what’s clipboard to do with all that. I have a little program which doesn’t leave anything in clipboard when it takes a shot
2020-12-17 10:43:16 <Taneb> shachaf: I was for a while but I haven't been thinking about them for a while
2020-12-17 10:45:29 <shachaf> nakilon: I think you're missing something about, I don't know, magnitude or weight or something.
2020-12-17 10:45:57 <nakilon> arseniiv that program calls API of your OS that returns it in BMP or specified format, that program might be configurable or improved
2020-12-17 10:46:12 <shachaf> Someone mentioned that 3MB was kind of big (and said they themselves wanted to take care of it for themselves, not even requested that anyone else do anything).
2020-12-17 10:46:38 <arseniiv> nakilon: yep it’s configurable and spews me out a png to a folder
2020-12-17 10:46:50 <arseniiv> no clipboard mess
2020-12-17 10:46:52 <shachaf> I saw that, took it into account, and slightly adjusted my weights in the future. Maybe next time I'll resize or convert the image, or maybe I'll just think about it.
2020-12-17 10:47:05 <nakilon> the size of content in internet isn't what the read requestor should care -- he can't compress it on the source
2020-12-17 10:47:43 <shachaf> That's all that needed to happen here, for either party. It's not a binary thing that is either broken or solved, just a continuum of preferences and things that you can adjust a bit.
2020-12-17 10:48:05 <arseniiv> for now I personally have a pretty good internet access so I would be glad to download maybe even a bmp
2020-12-17 10:48:06 <shachaf> So insisting that people adjust all sorts of things immediately with a particular solution you have in mind doesn't really help.

2020-12-17 10:49:01 <shachaf> I don't know whether you read what int-e said, but it was an idea about having a proxy that resizes images. Which is in the requester's control.
2020-12-17 10:49:12 <nakilon> switching to using non optimal data formats just because you've got faster internet is the same wrong thing as starting making worse software with worse algorithms just because you've got faster computers

2020-12-17 10:51:15 <Taneb> shachaf: one thing I've been thinking about is a SAT solver that aims to create as human-understandable proofs as possible
2020-12-17 10:51:43 <shachaf> That's interesting. What would those look like?
2020-12-17 10:52:00 <nakilon> do you realise the price you pay for internet would be several times smaller if people were not playing 4k videos on their broken glass 720p phones turned on behind their backs while they are cooking?
2020-12-17 10:52:09 <int-e> . o O ( brain saturation )
2020-12-17 10:52:31 <int-e> nakilon: that's likely false
2020-12-17 10:52:56 <Taneb> I think all the clauses would have to be named, and the solver would report things like "By clause xyz, we know that variable t must be false"
2020-12-17 10:53:22 <nakilon> the internet is overpolluted by data that isn't used and we pay for all the infrastructure for it
2020-12-17 10:53:25 <int-e> nakilon: the technology you're talking about is only being deployed because people actually use the bandwidth.
2020-12-17 10:53:57 <nakilon> effective data barely gets larger but the price stays the same let's say $20 per months no matter how better the hardware gets
2020-12-17 10:54:08 <nakilon> because people think "hey I've got so much room, lets trash it"
2020-12-17 10:54:10 <Taneb> It'd need to try and find a shallow proof when it needs to speculate, but I'm not sure which dimension it'd need to be shallow
2020-12-17 10:54:36 <nakilon> not even knowing that when they buy the "100mbit internet" it's only measured in peak
2020-12-17 10:54:41 <int-e> In an alternative history where nobody ever dared to use bandwidth you might be spending $20 a months plus a fixed rate per minute on dual ISDN lines.
2020-12-17 10:54:55 <int-e> or more, $20 seems rather low
2020-12-17 10:56:38 <nakilon> I pay $8
2020-12-17 10:56:46 <nakilon> in not the most technologically developed country
2020-12-17 10:56:52 <shachaf> Taneb: What sorts of proofs are you thinking of applying this to?
2020-12-17 10:56:56 <nakilon> so you can realise how much you overpay
2020-12-17 10:57:06 <shachaf> I wonder whether you'd rather have something higher-level than SAT for expressing things.
2020-12-17 10:57:06 <nakilon> because of people watching 4k with their backs
2020-12-17 10:57:09 <Taneb> shachaf: mostly little puzzle games like what's in sgtpuzzles
2020-12-17 10:57:19 <Taneb> Or at least, that's what inspired me down this line of thought
2020-12-17 10:57:23 <shachaf> Aha.
2020-12-17 10:57:35 <shachaf> Human solutions to these puzzles often look pretty different from computer solutions.
2020-12-17 10:57:54 <int-e> nakilon: that's way too simplistic. the rates are in a large part arbitrary and determined by available income of the people
2020-12-17 10:58:04 <int-e> it's not a free market, by and large
2020-12-17 10:58:17 <shachaf> Since humans are bad at backtracking, so they try to minimize it and find very short paths to contradictions.
2020-12-17 10:58:28 <nakilon> people will spend all their income without need getting anything for that
2020-12-17 10:58:51 <int-e> shachaf: humans will often prove lemmas that aren't expressed in a couple of clauses (which DPLL might learn)
2020-12-17 10:59:32 <shachaf> I think some puzzles are just not particularly human-solvable, even if they're in NP.
2020-12-17 10:59:47 <shachaf> Since "having a human solution path" is a stronger constraint than "having a solution".
2020-12-17 11:00:12 <shachaf> Another thing is that a human doesn't just want to satisfy the puzzle, they want to satisfy it uniquely, right?
2020-12-17 11:00:42 <int-e> shachaf: well, it depends on the human :)
2020-12-17 11:01:10 <shachaf> Sure, I'm proposing some model of what it means to be human-solvable, or human-fun.
2020-12-17 11:01:22 <Taneb> A lot of these puzzles have a unique solution by design (and I have taken that as an assumption in solving puzzles in the past)
2020-12-17 11:01:22 <int-e> speaking for myself, yes, I'm happier knowing that a solution is unique
2020-12-17 11:01:42 <int-e> Looking at some advanced Sudoku solving patterns... not all people care.
2020-12-17 11:02:06 <shachaf> I posted another sudoku: https://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Benutzer/eingestellt.php?name=shachaf
2020-12-17 11:02:15 <int-e> Oh no.
2020-12-17 11:02:17 <shachaf> I don't think it's that interesting.
2020-12-17 11:02:20 <int-e> What did I do.
2020-12-17 11:02:42 <shachaf> In some sense it's just an easier version of the 6-12 sudoku that int-e already solved.
2020-12-17 11:03:01 <int-e> fizzie: somehow, today's AoC task doesn't look very twisty :P
2020-12-17 11:03:06 <nakilon> why do you care about how the puzzle is solved, any solution will do, we have cool intel cpus in 2020
2020-12-17 11:03:18 <nakilon> just bruteforce it
2020-12-17 11:03:28 <fizzie> int-e: I *just* regenerated the plot, like, five minutes ago.
2020-12-17 11:03:30 <int-e> nakilon: it's called an intellectual challenge
2020-12-17 11:03:35 <shachaf> Of the four sudoku puzzles I posted, one of them can be solved entirely with unit propagation.
2020-12-17 11:03:56 <shachaf> Which maybe counts as extremely boring?
2020-12-17 11:04:02 <fizzie> And no, it's not very twisty.
2020-12-17 11:04:29 <nakilon> I just press the button "download the solution" and it downloads and I have it
2020-12-17 11:04:30 <int-e> People seem to struggle with it though.
2020-12-17 11:05:28 <fizzie> Also, now I've got an actual wrapper script to do the "fetch any new leaderboards, if there were any update the dataframe and redraw the plots"; http://ix.io/2Ip8
2020-12-17 11:05:43 <fizzie> It doesn't scp the results or run with cron yet, though.
2020-12-17 11:06:04 <fizzie> Also, it makes the assumption that if it's more than 2 hours after midnight Eastern time, it's okay to download the day's leaderboard.
2020-12-17 11:06:26 <fizzie> So if they do a trickier puzzle that takes more than 2 hours for the 100th person to solve, that might fail.
2020-12-17 11:06:39 <int-e> Well, that assumption has worked out fine so far.
2020-12-17 11:09:00 <fizzie> It's a historically pretty sound assumption, violated by 6 days out of 142.
2020-12-17 11:09:22 <int-e> how many of those were in 2015?
2020-12-17 11:09:49 <fizzie> 2015 days 1, 19 and 22; 2016 day 11; 2018 day 15; and 2019 day 22.
2020-12-17 11:10:50 <fizzie> On which days the 100th person took approximately 186, 232, 183, 164, 143 and 124 minutes to get two stars, respectively.
2020-12-17 11:12:27 <int-e> Oh yeah, I remember wondering on day 22 last year why it was so hard :P
2020-12-17 11:12:53 <nakilon> you may do again those messages that I assume to be rude, such as "you are looking for arguing" or "/help ignore" but I'm still amazed by how bad the idea is to make an end consumer of IRC screenshot links to setup and configure some proxy for his personal internet browsing instead of storing the content in a proper format in the first place,
2020-12-17 11:12:53 <nakilon> because he won't know he wants that piece of data compressed until he click the link and see that "oh it's that game screenshot" so he'll have to switch all his way of browsing the internet to a proxy solution and then switch to uncompressed format and redownload the link again if he sees "ah, this has details I should now turn the proxy off" just
2020-12-17 11:12:53 <nakilon> because some people are lazy to find a better way of sharing screenshots
2020-12-17 11:13:24 <int-e> nakilon: nobody is making me do anything here
2020-12-17 11:13:25 <nakilon> (tell me if the message didn't fit the irc limit if you care)

2020-12-17 11:30:28 <Taneb> shachaf: I am not very good at these fancy sudokus
2020-12-17 11:30:38 <Taneb> I'm not too great at regular sudokus, come to that
2020-12-17 11:31:17 <shachaf> The middle two are easier than the other two.
2020-12-17 11:31:19 <int-e> Taneb: the fancy ones may be easier than the regular ones because they rely less on obscure patterns that only sudoku experts have internalized
2020-12-17 11:31:46 <shachaf> That's also plausible.
2020-12-17 11:31:51 <int-e> (And I'm not a Sudoku expert.)
2020-12-17 11:31:54 <shachaf> The constraints for all of these puzzles are very strong.
2020-12-17 11:32:07 <shachaf> With no clues, I think the most recent one has 288 solutions.
2020-12-17 11:32:15 <shachaf> And the others were also in the range of hundreds.

2020-12-17 11:49:18 <rain1> hello
2020-12-17 11:50:03 <rain1> a pen and paper puzzle should have a unique solution that can be reached through deduction alone
2020-12-17 11:50:40 <rain1> but there is debate about whether or not the solver should exploit uniqueness to make deductions
2020-12-17 11:53:00 <shachaf> "deduction" means you find a satisfying assignment, and then you rule that one out, and then it's UNSAT, right?
2020-12-17 11:53:50 <int-e> shachaf: assuming X, you can show that there is not exactly one solution. Can you conclude not X?
2020-12-17 11:54:18 <shachaf> Sure, I know the uniqueness thing you mean.
2020-12-17 11:54:40 <shachaf> In some puzzles it's very blatant and happens all the time.
2020-12-17 11:54:54 <shachaf> With sudoku it's kind of rare but still happens.

2020-12-17 14:24:35 <int-e> . o O ( isn't shooting screens rather expensive in the long run )
2020-12-17 14:30:31 <b_jonas> I don't use any sort of OS built-in screnshot functionality. I make screenshots with the screenshot features built into GIMP or Irfanview, because if I take a screenshot, I always want to post-process it, like decide whether to keep or discard it, crop, possibly color reduce, possibly censor parts, occasionally stitch multiple screenshots, decide how to encode, decide the filename. You need a graphics
2020-12-17 14:30:37 <b_jonas> editor for some of that, and they can already do all the steps that come up, so there's no point to use anything else.
2020-12-17 14:31:25 <b_jonas> OS functionality made sense when all it did was read the characters from the video memory and send them to the line printer, and you didn't have the hardware to load a graphics editor program for that.

2020-12-17 14:35:05 <fizzie> Is there a standard web 3.11 API for detecting if the user prefers a dark theme or a light one? I imagine there must be.

2020-12-17 14:47:07 <b_jonas> consider the following single-player game. the level is a maze that's a graph with rooms for vertices and (undirected) corridors for edges. one vertex is marked as the player's location, and one as the goal.

2020-12-17 14:50:17 <b_jonas> each edge has a door. doors come in triples: each door is marked with a pair of a name and a state, where the state is one of open, ajar, closed, and each pair can only occur at most once. you can't walk through a closed door, and you can walk through an open door without any side effect. but when you walk through an ajar door, then it changes to open, the open door with the same name shuts to closed,
2020-12-17 14:50:23 <b_jonas> and the closed door with the same name changes to ajar, simultaneously. states of the doors with different name don't change during that, and the names of doors never change.

2020-12-17 14:52:03 <int-e> so... for each name, there are always three door, in a permutation of those three states?
2020-12-17 14:52:12 <int-e> three door*s*
2020-12-17 14:52:53 <b_jonas> solving this puzzle is clearly in PSPACE, but I'd like to know what computational complexity it has more preciesly. with doors I can simulate one-way corridors, and level crossings (in case you want a planar graph). I can also make a level that takes exponential number of steps to solve, using a simple binary counter. but I don't know if you can simulate general binary storage.
2020-12-17 14:52:59 <b_jonas> int-e: yes
2020-12-17 14:53:58 <b_jonas> int-e: and the three have a cyclic order, you can only pass through them in that order and not backwards, though you can pass through the same door multiple times without affecting that cyclic order, even if you pass through other doors between. and the cyclic order isn't quite enough, because the starting state has to be observed.
2020-12-17 14:54:16 <int-e> and of course you can put all the open doors in an unreachable area if you like
2020-12-17 14:54:23 <b_jonas> int-e: yes.
2020-12-17 14:54:37 <int-e> so the toggle mechanic is the most relevant
2020-12-17 14:54:52 <b_jonas> the other question that I'd like to know, besides computational complexity, is whether it's possible to make interesting puzzle levels from this, that is, ones that have only few doors and yet aren't trivial to solve.
2020-12-17 14:55:20 <b_jonas> int-e: no
2020-12-17 14:55:27 <int-e> oh wait
2020-12-17 14:55:30 <b_jonas> int-e: it's not a toggle mechanic, it's always a cyclic permutation of three
2020-12-17 14:55:47 <int-e> it's a cyclic shift, never mind
2020-12-17 14:56:24 <b_jonas> you can simulate a toggle where you have to pass two *directed* corridor-paths alternatingly, using multiple doors, if you wish
2020-12-17 14:56:41 <int-e> (A O C)
2020-12-17 14:56:45 <int-e> is that intentional?

2020-12-17 14:57:24 <b_jonas> a low entropy one though
2020-12-17 14:57:25 <int-e> makes it easier to remember
2020-12-17 14:58:15 <b_jonas> dunno
2020-12-17 14:59:19 <b_jonas> if not, I'd also like to know if you can make interesting puzzle levels from some extensions of this; and references for where something like this game is already known
2020-12-17 14:59:27 <int-e> .-A-.-C-.-O-. all with the same name is a directed edge (with some irrelevant extra state in the first door) :)
2020-12-17 15:01:46 <int-e> oh well, something to ponder... these kinds of things tend to take some time
2020-12-17 15:01:53 <b_jonas> int-e: I imagine it drawn more nethack-like: .#\#.#+#.#-#. where \ is an ajar door, + a closed door, - or | an open door in a horizontal or vertical corridor resp, and there's a letter close to each door next to the corridor that shows the names, plus there's color
2020-12-17 15:02:58 <b_jonas> and if those states really only have just two edges, then optionally draw them on one corridor without a room, like .#\##+##-#.

2020-12-17 15:13:14 <b_jonas> fizzie: I don't know what a snowman without snow is, but I feel repulsion towards the concept. I learned to ski as a small child, and a few times I had the terrible occasion to try these dry (i.e. without snow) ski pistes, where you ski on plastic tennis court floor with lubricants, and they're a really bad experience. I do admit that it's much cheaper than traveling to real ski pistes, so it's not just
2020-12-17 15:13:20 <b_jonas> pointless torture for children, but it's still torture. The dry piste is entirely flat with none of the interesting texture variations that a real snow terrain causes, and even besides that it feels bad.

2020-12-17 15:15:57 <b_jonas> fizzie: ah yes, and I assume you combine any of these basic snowman code points with gender symbols, skin tone modifiers, hairstyle modifiers, eyelash style modifiers, eye color modifiers, height modifiers, chin shape modifiers, nose shape modifiers, headgear modifiers, etc, to get more complex characters
2020-12-17 15:16:08 <fizzie> The shapes my browser's choice of fonts have for SNOWMAN, SNOWMAN WITHOUT SNOW and BLACK SNOWMAN are all completely different. SNOWMAN is this outline, BLACK SNOWMAN is filled but still just a (different) black-and-white shape, and SNOWMAN WITHOUT SNOW is this coloured monstrosity.
2020-12-17 15:16:27 <b_jonas> and perhaps with some vegetable emoji code points too to get snowman with particular vegetables used as their nose
2020-12-17 15:17:50 <b_jonas> fizzie: perhaps the plain snowman is from smaller fonts and the others from huge fallback fonts, and perhaps one is rendered as an emoji by default and the others aren't. you could try to force the font and the emojiness if you wish.
2020-12-17 15:18:03 <nakilon> emojis in unicode should be uninvented

2020-12-17 15:20:03 <nakilon> fizzie did you solve day 3 part 2?
2020-12-17 15:20:59 <fizzie> I didn't touch day 3 yet (in Befunge-98). I've done days 1, 2, 5, 6 and first half of day 8.
2020-12-17 15:21:00 <nakilon> I guess it needs rereading the stdin and so storing it
2020-12-17 15:22:51 <fizzie> I imagine you *could* evaluate all five slopes at once as you go through it, though then you'd need to keep five counters at once (in addition to the current location).
2020-12-17 15:23:26 <fizzie> I think for day 3 I couldn't decide whether it would be okay to use the `i` instruction or not.
2020-12-17 15:23:50 <nakilon> how does the debugger you use look like? I see different images in google image search
2020-12-17 15:24:11 <nakilon> I just do ...........A,@ in random places and run until it hits and halts
2020-12-17 15:24:11 <fizzie> The thing is, I'd kind of like all the solutions to keep the same structure of just reading puzzle input from stdin, but `i` needs a file name. I could use /dev/stdin maybe.
2020-12-17 15:26:23 <nakilon> maybe '-'?
2020-12-17 15:26:38 <fizzie> I don't think that'd work in the implementations I've got.
2020-12-17 15:26:44 <nakilon> I guess it's some standard for naming the stdin, didn't know about /dev/stdin
2020-12-17 15:27:17 <fizzie> It's pretty common, yes, but it needs the program to interpret it. /dev/stdin has some chance of working even when not explicitly supported.
2020-12-17 15:28:17 <nakilon> I just skip until the next line, then skip number of chars calculated with modulo, but the case of "down 2" would need something else
2020-12-17 15:28:54 <nakilon> like passing the how many times you skip until newline
2020-12-17 15:28:58 <fizzie> And I don't really have a "debugger" as such. I've been making do with `cfunge -t 10` (which just prints a trace like http://ix.io/2Ia8 out), plus that JS debugger (which has okay single-stepping and visualization, but can't do input, so it can only be used on fragments). I have a lot of ideas I'd like to see in my dream Befunge development tool (like per-cell annotations that'd be automatically shown on
2020-12-17 15:29:04 <fizzie> a multi-line status line), but it'd take effort to implement that.
2020-12-17 15:29:25 <fizzie> I think there's a bunch of Befunge-93 browser things, but for '98 the implementation situation seems a bit more bare.
2020-12-17 15:29:58 <nakilon> unfortunately Ruby isn't tuned for GUI apps
2020-12-17 15:30:08 <nakilon> I mean it has no cool libraries
2020-12-17 15:30:38 <nakilon> only some monstrous bindings, and when someone tried to make it as simple as possible that resulted in something limited
2020-12-17 15:30:59 <fizzie> Well, a TUI is what I'd like anyway. I've been eyeing tcell (in Go) if I do start making it.
2020-12-17 15:31:02 <nakilon> and wxwidgets were segfaulting and then abandoned AFAIK
2020-12-17 15:33:25 <nakilon> curses would do the job but it would also have to intercept the stdout
2020-12-17 15:34:08 <nakilon> wouldn't be a problem though
2020-12-17 15:35:41 <nakilon> damn, I've got so much things to do and now I want to implement the debugger, oh no...

2020-12-17 15:37:54 <fizzie> I want the playfield grid view to show cell values 32-126 as their printable ASCII counterparts, values 1-31 using the braille patterns as binary, value 0 maybe as WHITE DIAMOND and values <0 and >=127 as BLACK DIAMOND (of course showing the actual value on the status line).
2020-12-17 15:38:00 <fizzie> And I want two rows reserved for the cell annotations shown permanently, and I'd use the top line by convention for stack annotations, and I want the enter key to switch focus between the grid and the annotation window.
2020-12-17 15:38:05 <fizzie> And I want arrow keys to also as a side effect change the direction into which the cursor moves when you insert a character, but I also want to allow specifying a vector directly.
2020-12-17 15:38:10 <fizzie> And I want mod-space to set a mark that can be used to define a highlighted rectangular region, which can also have other rectangles or individual cells added to or removed from, so that the arbitrarily shaped region can then be moved around or copied. Possibly rotated with automatic treatment of <>v^ too (I know some Befunge IDEs do that), though I'm a bit ambivalent about that.
2020-12-17 15:40:31 <fizzie> And obviously I also want a single-stepping debugger that defaults the grid to a view mode, but also allows switching the grid to edit mode to tweaks, and also shows (and allows changing) the stack.
2020-12-17 15:41:10 <fizzie> Oh, and I want the grid view section to be arbitrarily splittable to frames which each have their own origin, though can also be set to track a specific IP.
2020-12-17 15:41:32 <nakilon> rasel would not need to display program space values since you don't write to it
2020-12-17 15:42:05 <fizzie> BefungeSharp might be closest already existing thing to what I want, and if it wasn't Windows-only, I might even consider using it.
2020-12-17 15:42:18 <nakilon> instead would need to display more stack values I guess
2020-12-17 15:42:47 <nakilon> hehe, C#
2020-12-17 15:43:09 <fizzie> I imagine you might want something like different stack value display options, in case you often have complex data in a single value.
2020-12-17 15:44:14 <nakilon> rationals need more space than integers, yeah
2020-12-17 15:45:15 <nakilon> didn't use numbers with fractional parts a lot but they exist at least temporary, when you emulate multiplication
2020-12-17 15:45:30 <fizzie> The other thing that exists is Bequnge, but I think it goes a little too far into the >2D stuff, visualizations, and sound effects. https://hatstand.github.io/Bequnge/screenshots.html
2020-12-17 15:46:13 <fizzie> Then again, as the author of GLfunge98, which was supposed to do exactly those similar things (except I abandoned it ages ago) I shouldn't probably be allowed to criticize.
2020-12-17 15:46:42 <nakilon> yay, 3d, needs VR
2020-12-17 15:47:43 <fizzie> There's an HP-UX port of GLfunge98, which I find pleasantly odd.

2020-12-17 16:17:03 <nakilon> hmmmm
2020-12-17 16:17:13 <nakilon> does Cat program have to exit with 0?
2020-12-17 16:17:50 <myname> no
2020-12-17 16:18:00 <myname> cat /foo exits with 1
2020-12-17 16:18:49 <nakilon> my BSD one exits with 0
2020-12-17 16:19:00 <nakilon> ah
2020-12-17 16:19:15 <nakilon> okay, it exists with 1
2020-12-17 16:19:25 <nakilon> but should it exit with 0 on success?
2020-12-17 16:27:23 <b_jonas> probably. most programs should exit with 0 exit code on success, with the exception of a few programs that are specifically useful to test some condition, like test and grep
2020-12-17 16:28:13 <int-e> b_jonas: the answer is yes. we can fit it into the framework of https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1895 using a door gadget like https://int-e.eu/~bf3/tmp/aoc.png (which makes liberal use of directed edges as explained earlier)
2020-12-17 16:29:01 <int-e> b_jonas: the most relevant door is the blue door at the bottom (I should have highlighted it somehow); the diagram shows the open state at the top and the closed state below
2020-12-17 16:31:06 <int-e> (updated with a bit of emphasis for the relevant door)
2020-12-17 16:31:59 <b_jonas> int-e: ah, I didn't recall the exact conditions of that article. I'll have to re-read some of it. so apparently it's enough to have one door, one open button, and one close button linked together, rather than, say, multiple open buttons or multiple doors linked?
2020-12-17 16:32:36 <int-e> b_jonas: yep, one path is enough. furthermore, it's okay if the open path doesn't always work
2020-12-17 16:32:48 <int-e> so just adding a bypass like I did is okay
2020-12-17 16:33:45 <b_jonas> I guess that part is from the earlier Sokoban article, not this one
2020-12-17 16:33:55 <int-e> maybe
2020-12-17 16:36:46 <int-e> I lost track of the articles. The requirements of the door gadget can be found there anyway.
2020-12-17 16:40:37 <int-e> (and crossover isn't needed as long as the graph is not required to be planar)
2020-12-17 16:41:14 <b_jonas> int-e: sure, but for this game we can create a crossover gadget (though it's not cheap, so in a real puzzle version you might add that and one-way doors as primitives)
2020-12-17 16:41:27 <int-e> (but in fact we can make one with the same principle shown by the green and red doors, without the blue one)
2020-12-17 16:41:48 <b_jonas> yes, I did say above that I can make a crossover
2020-12-17 16:42:04 <int-e> Sorry, I didn't read, I was busy making my own gadget.
2020-12-17 16:42:25 <b_jonas> makes sense, since I didn't say how to create a crossover
2020-12-17 16:44:48 <int-e> b_jonas: oh wait. I should've seen it, but I skipped the middle part and focussed on the binary counter...
2020-12-17 16:45:38 <int-e> you even mentioned directed edges there
2020-12-17 16:45:49 <int-e> (one-way corridors)
2020-12-17 16:49:58 <int-e> b_jonas: for puzzles though I guess you have to work actively against the fact that 2/3 of all edges are passable at any given time
2020-12-17 16:50:00 <b_jonas> yes, those are bisimulable with one-way gadgets
2020-12-17 16:50:51 <b_jonas> to make a one-way corridor, you can just add a one-way gadget before and a one-way gadget after; to make a one-way gadget, make a one-way edge with an irrelevant open door
2020-12-17 16:50:53 <int-e> (So naively, I'd expect random puzzles to be very easy.)
2020-12-17 16:51:34 <b_jonas> int-e: that would depend on how you sample random, but yes, I also figured it's not easy to just generate good puzzles randomly
2020-12-17 16:52:09 <b_jonas> and there are too many graphs and possiblel levels to brute force search all of them for potentially interesting ones
2020-12-17 16:53:50 <b_jonas> and adding one-ways and/or crossovers (or teleporters) as primitives doesn't change any of that
2020-12-17 16:54:15 <b_jonas> I mean it makes making puzzles slightly easier, but it still seems hard that way
2020-12-17 16:55:42 <b_jonas> I just defined the base game without them for simplicity and elegance
2020-12-17 16:56:32 <b_jonas> I would add such convenience things to a real puzzle implementation, because they make the puzzle easier to understand by humans. crossovers and one-ways are natural to understand, they make the puzzle easier to learn and navigate than the corresponding constructions.
2020-12-17 16:56:44 <int-e> okay, one more update to the png... lighter gray and I got rid of the spikes at the bottom of the ajar doors
2020-12-17 16:57:24 <int-e> the gadget is unchanged, I think it's pretty neat as it is.
2020-12-17 16:58:12 <b_jonas> your graphical representation is very different from what I imagine. I use a top-view map of the maze, with doors drawn as short lines (as short as a corridor) from the same top view, and with letters (and optional colors) to mark matching ones
2020-12-17 16:58:36 <b_jonas> rather than side view doors
2020-12-17 16:58:50 <int-e> I'm not a nethack player
2020-12-17 16:59:06 <int-e> I think that has a huge influence :)
2020-12-17 17:00:03 <int-e> (nor roguelikes in general, even graphical ones)
2020-12-17 17:00:12 <b_jonas> (and also uppercasing the letter for currently ajar doors. the sequence of names of ajar doors you go through is enough to represent your solution in an easy way.)
2020-12-17 17:02:33 <int-e> b_jonas: I'm sure you can figure out your own preferred representation :-P
2020-12-17 17:20:21 <nakilon> caught another bug in '&' -- since it was working as reading the byte, then checking if it's a digit and then pushing it back when not, it failed if the file ends with integer instead of non-digit, such as newline
2020-12-17 17:21:40 <nakilon> I mean not caught but found it while changing how ~ and & work; with working as trampoline instead of reversing the Cat program now does not need '#' and so is one char shorter

2020-12-17 19:42:45 <oren> Unicode mailing list debates having italics... again
2020-12-17 19:43:56 User Name: rain1 = rain1!~My_user_n@unaffiliated/rain1
2020-12-17 19:43:56 <rain1> please no italics
2020-12-17 19:44:13 <myname> i think they should also add bold, underline, subscript, superscript, strikethrough and blink
2020-12-17 19:44:34 <kmc> and every combination of those
2020-12-17 19:44:45 <rain1> blink, yes
2020-12-17 19:44:50 <rain1> remember twhe they added emoji
2020-12-17 19:44:51 <rain1> when*
2020-12-17 19:45:41 <myname> well, blame japan for that
2020-12-17 19:49:38 <kmc> i like emoji
2020-12-17 19:49:38 <kmc> and i like that i can compatibly use them across multiple platforms
2020-12-17 19:51:00 <kmc> someone near me has the vanity license plate "U1F47E" on their car
2020-12-17 19:54:08 <nakilon> they could have no problem of compatibility at all
2020-12-17 19:54:26 <nakilon> if they didn't use it in the first place
2020-12-17 19:55:39 <nakilon> why no Putin emoji?
2020-12-17 19:59:01 <kmc> feel free to submit a proposal for one
2020-12-17 19:59:30 <nakilon> I don't propose bad ideas
2020-12-17 19:59:41 <kmc> that's a good policy
2020-12-17 19:59:56 <nakilon> emojis was a bad ide
2020-12-17 19:59:57 <nakilon> a
2020-12-17 20:01:09 <nakilon> but if they implement a bad idea, I just ask why don't they implement all other bad ideas
2020-12-17 20:01:22 <nakilon> Get Things Done you know
2020-12-17 20:01:26 <kmc> lol
