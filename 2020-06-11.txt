2020-06-11 01:20:10 <tswett[m]> Anyone have a nice example of an easily computable function which is a bijection, but whose inverse is difficult to compute?
2020-06-11 01:20:56 <tswett[m]> I just thought of a function which technically qualifies, but whose domain (which is identical to its codomain) is itself very difficult to compute.
2020-06-11 01:21:32 <tswett[m]> The domain is the collection of all 1000x1000 grids of bits which loop in Conway's Game of Life.
2020-06-11 01:21:49 <tswett[m]> It's easy to compute the next state; it's hard to compute the previous state.

2020-06-11 02:06:23 <zzo38> Wizards of the Coast has removed some card images from their database, banned those cards (even in Vintage, I think), and even changed the multiverse ID number of a single card. Let it be known that I oppose this kind of behaviour, regardless of the reason. (They say it is because those cards are racist. What they should do then is to stop making racist cards; they shouldn't erase the history of the cards.)
2020-06-11 02:07:30 <zzo38> There are valid reasons to ban some cards in some formats, but probably not in Vintage.
2020-06-11 02:07:49 <zzo38> They can, of course, put those cards in the reserve list and never print them again; that is OK too, I suppose.

2020-06-11 02:20:06 <zzo38> Unfortunately, the change in the multiverse ID number makes even more of a mess; if they do reverse that decision, then that card will need to have two multiverse ID numbers for the same printing, and that is no good either. Removing the new multiverse ID number is also bad, because now that number is assigned for that card and someone might use the new multiverse ID number.

2020-06-11 02:29:34 <zzo38> (This banning also has an unfortunate interaction with one of the silver bordered cards, and trying to deal with that (even if they undo their changes) would probably make even more of a mess than it already is. Well, I think.)
2020-06-11 02:31:31 <zzo38> (Of course, if they are banned in some formats due to game balance problems (or because the cards are rare and you are playing a format that forbids rare cards), then they should remain banned, but this should presumably not include Vintage, I think.)

2020-06-11 02:38:41 <Cale> I don't know, it seems fine to me for them to eliminate cards from the game if those cards no longer reflect their company's values in some way.
2020-06-11 02:39:49 <Cale> The fact that Invoke Prejudice had a multiverse ID of 1488 is pretty suspicious.

2020-06-11 02:47:14 <zzo38> :It is probably just a coincidence. But it doesn't matter. They shouldn't change the past. They can change the future instead, I think. If they no longer like those cards, then they should not longer print them.
2020-06-11 02:49:15 <Cale> I'm not sure this counts as changing the past
2020-06-11 02:49:34 <zzo38> If you don't like the number 13, 666, 1488, 1984, or whatever, that is too bad, because in a list of consecutively numbered items (or pages, or cards) with that many or more items, those numbers will be used in their proper place. (I also don't like elevators omitting 13, of course.)
2020-06-11 02:51:30 <Cale> Yeah, but when a racially-charged card whose image depicts pointy-hooded figures just happens to get a number by which a white supremacist slogan are identified, that's a hell of a coincidence.
2020-06-11 02:52:16 <Cale> I see it as well within their rights to rearrange all the card IDs as much as they want
2020-06-11 02:52:42 <zzo38> Yes, I suppose it is a hell of a coincidence. But I think that rearranging multiverse IDs (regardless of why) is problematic.
2020-06-11 02:53:14 <zzo38> Among other things, it goes against the W3C's policy, I think.
2020-06-11 02:53:49 <Cale> I mean, it affects some URLs, but despite the W3C's wishes, URLs rarely stay the same for very long.
2020-06-11 02:54:31 <Cale> It's probably best that no other card take the place of that one, just to avoid confusion
2020-06-11 02:54:42 <Cale> I don't know why they bothered assigning it a new ID actually
2020-06-11 02:55:47 <Cale> I guess because they get to post the message that it's banned from tournament play etc. that way
2020-06-11 02:57:06 <zzo38> Yes, it is best that no other card (or other printing of the same card in a different set, which fortunately there isn't any) takes that multiverse ID.
2020-06-11 02:58:17 <Cale> But if you look at, say, Hearthstone -- it hasn't had to deal with this particular problem, but cards are revised all the time in that game, and people's collections are forcibly updated along with it.
2020-06-11 02:58:43 <zzo38> I think Hearthstone is quite a different problem entirely.
2020-06-11 02:58:45 <Cale> Of course, they try not to do it too much, but it still seems a reasonable thing to do
2020-06-11 02:59:04 <Cale> It's a bit different because there aren't physical bits of cardboard in the world

2020-06-11 03:00:29 <zzo38> Yes, but it can still be a problem, and a different one. You might want to use old rules, you might not like their software, etc. Actually, Magic: the Gathering also has the problem of old versions of the rules and Oracle texts not properly being archived, I think.
2020-06-11 03:01:35 <zzo38> What ais523 did seems reasonable though: The primary key of a card definition is the name and version together, rather than only the name. That partially avoids the problem in Hearthstone, at least.

2020-06-11 03:02:07 <ais523> I don't think I did that?
2020-06-11 03:02:20 <zzo38> Of course, it is too late to change it now in either Magic: the Gathering or in Hearthstone, I think.
2020-06-11 03:02:30 <ais523> name+version is the normal primary key in M:tG databases, though (except for Oracle-alikes)
2020-06-11 03:03:23 <Cale> As I see it, there's no responsibility for the maker of a game to continue to support any part of it, or maintain historical information for themselves if they want to make changes. Obviously, people who are interested in the history of the game can maintain that information.
2020-06-11 03:03:25 <zzo38> ais523: You did; I have the document you wrote on my computer.
2020-06-11 03:03:52 <zzo38> Cale: Yes, I maintain history of the rules as far back as possible. Rule history and Oracle history are very important for puzzles.
2020-06-11 03:04:08 <ais523> zzo38: oh, you mean not for M:tG
2020-06-11 03:04:33 <ais523> that was a bit different because version numbers are part of the card, the intention was that reprinting a card would use the same version number, but a different number could be used for, e.g., balance fixes
2020-06-11 03:05:01 <ais523> zzo38: are there any puzzles that require using multiple different sets of rules over the course of the puzzle?
2020-06-11 03:05:26 <zzo38> You may be right about other M:tG databases,  but I don't really know. I think the artwork should remain archived, even if they would never be reprinted.
2020-06-11 03:06:26 <zzo38> ais523: I don't know of any such puzzles, and most puzzles I know of don't specify a rules datestamp at all (except my own, to avoid this kind of problem).
2020-06-11 03:07:22 <zzo38> What you say about version numbers, I know what you are saying, and it makes sense, but I meant as an alternative to what is probably being done in Hearthstone (at least, what I have heard; I think my brother plays), and not about Magic: the Gathering.
2020-06-11 03:10:07 <ais523> I'm generally in favour of old versions / rules engines / patches of computer games being available in case they're superior to the current version (or more interesting in some other way), or just for historical interest
2020-06-11 03:10:30 <ais523> this is one of the reasons I dislike "inherently online" games because they often have no way to play an old version
2020-06-11 03:10:39 <zzo38> Yes, I agree with that.
2020-06-11 03:11:01 <Cale> Yeah, all else being equal, that's preferable
2020-06-11 03:14:57 <Cale> Chess 1.2 Patch Notes: * Fixed a bug introduced with faster pawns in 1.1 where pawns would sometimes capture a piece on different square from the one where they were going. * Fixed a bug where castling sometimes wouldn't work when unrelated back-rank squares were under attack. * We're aware of the bugs where pawns can't capture the piece that's in front of them, and can't move diagonally in cases where they're not
2020-06-11 03:14:58 <Cale> capturing a piece, and are working on fixes - stay tuned in the next patch.

2020-06-11 03:23:59 <zzo38> Does anyone still maintain the old Oracle texts and artwork? Does anyone maintain even changes to multiverse ID numbers if needed? What about rule changes? I think Yawgatog used to do some of these, but no longer does. I have a directory on my computer of all versions of the rules since 2007-05-01, but I am interested in older rules too, because there are puzzles older than that.
