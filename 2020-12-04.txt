2020-12-04 00:50:17 <HackEso> hth ([ʰtʰh̩]) is help received from a hairy toe. It is not at all hambiguitous.
2020-12-04 00:54:49 <moony> `? hackeso
2020-12-04 00:54:50 <HackEso> HackEso is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike HackEgo.

2020-12-04 00:54:56 <HackEso> HackEgo, also known as HackBot, is a bot that runs arbitrary commands on Unix. See `help for info on using it. You should totally try to hax0r it! Make sure you imagine it's running as root with no sandboxing. HackEgo is the slowest bot in all Mexico!
2020-12-04 00:55:48 <int-e> Regarding an AoC #esoteric leaderboard... I try hard not to be competetive about this. So I'm rather disinclined.
2020-12-04 00:57:48 <int-e> Not that that should stop anybody. But it won't be large enough for lurking anonymously (in contrast to the #haskell one which I did actually join)
