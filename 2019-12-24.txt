2019-12-24 04:57:37 <tswett[m]> Hey, anyone want to hire me? I have five years of professional experience as a software developer, and I'm really, really, really good at math. I'm not interested in software development positions. I'm looking for a salary around $60k.
2019-12-24 04:59:17 User Name: imode = imode!~linear@unaffiliated/imode
2019-12-24 04:59:17 <imode> what position are you looking for exactly.
2019-12-24 04:59:59 <tswett[m]> I don't have an exact position in mind.
2019-12-24 05:00:11 <int-e> Yeah, "not interested" will be the only thing anybody reads in there.
2019-12-24 05:00:32 <int-e> Unfortunately.
2019-12-24 05:01:08 <int-e> Unfortunately we live in a world where people expect you to know what you want :-/
2019-12-24 05:01:17 <imode> if you don't know what you want apply to a FAANG.
2019-12-24 05:02:22 <int-e> Well, what if your ethics aren't flexible enough for that?
2019-12-24 05:03:03 <tswett[m]> int-e: That makes sense.
2019-12-24 05:03:17 <imode> I don't think your average systems engineering job requires ethics that can bend over backwards
2019-12-24 05:03:38 <imode> I work at Amazon. you'd be surprised how mundane this job actually is from every standpoint. we just help people buy ebooks.
2019-12-24 05:04:00 <kmc> i'm giving up on the software industry
2019-12-24 05:04:05 <kmc> i think i'm going to become a mushroom farmer
2019-12-24 05:04:13 <imode> good choice.
2019-12-24 05:04:20 <kmc> we'll see
2019-12-24 05:04:54 <tswett[m]> Yeah, I like that idea.
2019-12-24 05:04:56 <int-e> A hacker's dream, build something from wood... simple and sturdy.
2019-12-24 05:05:15 <int-e> (That's based on a pun that works much better in german.)
2019-12-24 05:05:30 <imode> build your own computing ecosystem.
2019-12-24 05:06:24 <tswett[m]> I like that idea too.
2019-12-24 05:06:54 <imode> are you in desperate need of a job.
2019-12-24 05:06:54 <tswett[m]> I think I'm going to dogfood an operating system for the original IBM PC.
2019-12-24 05:07:20 <tswett[m]> Yes.
2019-12-24 05:07:34 <imode> what are your skills and where are you located.
2019-12-24 05:09:02 <tswett[m]> Well, I have experience in plenty of programming languages: C#, Perl, SQL, and bits of C++, HTML, JavaScript, Rust, and VBA.
2019-12-24 05:09:26 <zzo38> If you will make a operating system for the original IBM PC, then maybe you should use x86 assembly language.
2019-12-24 05:09:29 <imode> got any examples of things you've built with these tools.
2019-12-24 05:09:41 <imode> any past work experience.
2019-12-24 05:09:43 <tswett[m]> I have a degree in math and knowledge of bits and pieces here and there. I like Haskell and category theory.
2019-12-24 05:10:03 <tswett[m]> Yeah, here's the flight simulator autopilot I wrote in C#. https://github.com/tswett/WarrigalsAutopilot
2019-12-24 05:10:18 <tswett[m]> I have several professional software development positions.
2019-12-24 05:10:28 <imode> such as.
2019-12-24 05:11:08 <tswett[m]> Diagnosed and fixed issues with a large variety of production software for Priority Health, the health insurance arm of Spectrum Health.
2019-12-24 05:11:27 <tswett[m]> Wrote desktop application software for the ‚ÄúeXact‚Äù line of color measurement instruments using both C# and C++.
2019-12-24 05:11:30 <tswett[m]> That kind of stuff :D
2019-12-24 05:12:25 <imode> neat. do you have any idea of the roles/duties you'd like to take on at your next position.
2019-12-24 05:13:59 <shachaf> zzo38: Which assembly syntax should I use?
2019-12-24 05:14:02 <shachaf> Or should I make my own?
2019-12-24 05:16:07 <zzo38> shachaf: I don't know. Depend what assembler software you use, I suppose. Make up your own if you do not like that one.
2019-12-24 05:17:59 <tswett[m]> imode: Vaguely. I'd like to be an actuary (for one); I'd like to compile and analyze data in order to make calculations related to financial risk.
2019-12-24 05:18:26 <imode> so find actuary positions.
2019-12-24 05:19:52 <tswett[m]> I'm working on it.
2019-12-24 05:20:12 <kmc> there are/were a number of banks that use Haskell for modelling financial contracts
2019-12-24 05:20:30 <kmc> so perhaps you could get a job which isn't just programming, but utilizes your programming skills
2019-12-24 05:21:06 <kmc> int-e: what's the german pun?
2019-12-24 05:23:39 <tswett[m]> That does sound interesting.
2019-12-24 05:25:31 <kmc> thinking about work makes me sad
2019-12-24 05:25:38 <int-e> kmc: There's "hacken" meaning to chop wood.
2019-12-24 05:26:00 <int-e> Arguably not much of a pun.
2019-12-24 05:26:02 <imode> kmc: you retired?
2019-12-24 05:26:10 <kmc> i used to love programming but 10 years of working in the tech industry while struggling with mental health problems killed that :/
2019-12-24 05:26:28 <kmc> i flamed out
2019-12-24 05:26:34 <shachaf> I'm kittensitting this week. It's so good.
2019-12-24 05:26:36 <kmc> my spouse supports me financially
2019-12-24 05:26:41 <imode> oof.
2019-12-24 05:26:52 <imode> what happened, if you don't mind me asking?
2019-12-24 05:27:03 <int-e> shachaf: cushions are less messy
2019-12-24 05:27:09 <shachaf> I quit my job a longish time ago and haven't mustered up the whatever to get another one.
2019-12-24 05:27:18 <shachaf> Maybe I'll do that at one point?
2019-12-24 05:27:32 <imode> you must have quite a bit of savings or financial cushion.
2019-12-24 05:27:53 <tswett[m]> One option is to, instead of getting another job, just retire now and live off of $90 a month.
2019-12-24 05:27:54 <kmc> imode: it's a long story and not one i wish to retell at this moment
2019-12-24 05:28:08 <kmc> I had savings, not so much anymore
2019-12-24 05:28:12 <kmc> like I said, my spouse supports me
2019-12-24 05:28:21 <imode> kmc: that was moreso directed at shachaf, sorry.
2019-12-24 05:28:26 <imode> the last message, I mean.
2019-12-24 05:28:26 <kmc> oh, sorry

2019-12-24 05:28:41 <shachaf> I suspected as much.
2019-12-24 05:28:45 <kmc> that is also a long story i don't wish to retell

2019-12-24 05:29:22 <kmc> int-e: I get the pun now, thanks
2019-12-24 05:29:30 <shachaf> I am also sad now.
2019-12-24 05:29:42 <kmc> it works in english, once you know what it's supposed to be
2019-12-24 05:29:47 <tswett[m]> I like everyone.
2019-12-24 05:30:01 <tswett[m]> What's mine...
2019-12-24 05:30:02 <imode> I've been poor for a very long time now. this job is a miracle despite being not creatively fulfilling. but holy shit is it almost a cake walk.

2019-12-24 05:46:10 <kmc> life's a fucking trip, eh?
2019-12-24 05:46:31 <imode> yeah.
2019-12-24 05:47:09 <imode> I've had a similar stint in the industry and there have been times (including recently) where I've just wanted to give it all up.
2019-12-24 05:47:21 <imode> was homeless at one point.
2019-12-24 05:47:32 <kmc> damn
2019-12-24 05:47:34 <kmc> for how long?
2019-12-24 05:47:51 <imode> around 7 months.
2019-12-24 05:49:45 <imode> at one point I thought of becoming a writer. or working in retail. I got into programming sort of by accident and never started anything as a career. it's hard when working takes your hobbies and turns them against you.
2019-12-24 05:50:13 <kmc> yeah :(
2019-12-24 05:50:25 <kmc> don't do something you love, or you'll come to hate it
2019-12-24 05:50:27 <kmc> that's how i feel
2019-12-24 05:50:39 <kmc> but it probably depends
2019-12-24 05:51:22 <imode> I wanted to stop as early as August of this year, when I left my last position. I was essentially told that I was less than dog shit despite designing the core of the entire business from the ground up.
2019-12-24 05:51:50 <imode> drifted for a month. wanted to quit. came close to ending it. then I got a call from an Amazon recruiter.
2019-12-24 05:52:05 <kmc> "don't take something you love and try to pursue it within a bullshit corporation where most of your success/failure is not even dependent on how well you can do that something you love"
2019-12-24 05:52:20 <kmc> it's probably better if you, like, love carpentry and manage to make a little money selling tables you made in your garage, or something
2019-12-24 05:52:29 <imode> I used to think that too.
2019-12-24 05:53:12 <imode> but I think I favor rigidity in a lot of ways. nothing says you have to be passionate about your work life. larger corporations (usually) give you the opportunity for work/life balance. I use my spare time to work on what I want.
2019-12-24 05:53:13 <kmc> most jobs I worked ended due to mental health problems (whether me quitting or them firing me)
2019-12-24 05:53:22 <kmc> yeah
2019-12-24 05:53:44 <kmc> sometimes i just got depressed and stopped going in to work
2019-12-24 05:54:02 <imode> reward detachment is a real thing.

2019-12-24 05:54:27 <imode> you aren't hunting food and then feeling a full stomach. you're sitting at a desk or in a meeting to earn tokens to exhange for goods which may or may not be food.
2019-12-24 05:54:40 <imode> that's three levels of indirection just to get to a reward.
2019-12-24 05:56:00 <kmc> yes
2019-12-24 05:56:07 <kmc> alienation of labor
2019-12-24 05:56:42 <kmc> it does enable us to have some nice things, though
2019-12-24 05:56:55 <kmc> perhaps it requires a mindset that is unnatural and somewhat hard to come by
2019-12-24 05:57:35 <imode> labor is an application of energy. energy is a finite resource with multiple sources and sinks. depending on the job, the distribution of energy into different labors may not be ideal to your working lifestyle. in which case, time to find a new company.
2019-12-24 05:57:43 <imode> I used to work 12 hour days, 6 day weeks.
2019-12-24 05:57:58 <imode> that's unnatural and unsustainable.
2019-12-24 05:59:21 <imode> imo it's useful to not think of as money as a reward, but as a requirement for life. once you've met the requirement, _then_ you can use your remaining energy to do whateeeeever you want.
2019-12-24 05:59:41 <imode> people chase cash and then burn out because the cash wasn't a reward enough to them.
2019-12-24 05:59:54 <imode> don't know if that was part of your cse.
2019-12-24 05:59:57 <imode> s/cse/case
2019-12-24 06:00:55 <kmc> no not really
2019-12-24 06:00:59 <kmc> i've never been that motivated by money
2019-12-24 06:01:08 <int-e> imode: "necessary evil" comes to mind
2019-12-24 06:01:09 <kmc> when I was working I always made more than enough to be comfortable
2019-12-24 06:01:27 <imode> we talking east or west coast tech salaries.
2019-12-24 06:01:44 <kmc> um, some of each? and also startups that didn't pay that much salary, but still plenty
2019-12-24 06:02:08 <imode> I ask because I used to frame "more than enough" around $60k.
2019-12-24 06:02:20 <imode> then I was introduced to the concept of $150k+.
2019-12-24 06:02:29 <kmc> there was one job where I got way too into it and worked too many hours, but that's because i cared about the thing not because of money or being obliged to
2019-12-24 06:02:54 <kmc> $150k of which half immediately goes to your landlord ;P
2019-12-24 06:03:07 <imode> where you renting. o_O
2019-12-24 06:03:12 <kmc> (not quite that bad, but not too far off)
2019-12-24 06:03:24 <imode> damn that's hard.
2019-12-24 06:03:55 <kmc> you said west coast tech industry. housing in the san francisco area is insanely expensive
2019-12-24 06:04:07 <kmc> you need a household income of $350k to buy a median house
2019-12-24 06:04:09 <imode> PNW.
2019-12-24 06:04:14 <imode> washington.
2019-12-24 06:04:17 <kmc> Seattle's pretty expensive too
2019-12-24 06:04:23 <kmc> but at least they are building housing at an adequate rate
2019-12-24 06:04:49 <imode> I live much further up north, you'd be surprised at 1. how affordable things are and 2. how good the public transit is.
2019-12-24 06:05:24 <imode> currently we pay around $2k for rent + utils.
2019-12-24 06:05:34 <imode> and it's a 4 bedroom house.
2019-12-24 06:07:30 <imode> the lack of state taxes is also nice. really wouldn't live in seattle though.
2019-12-24 06:28:05 <kmc> yeah that's crazy cheap
2019-12-24 06:28:17 <kmc> we pay $3k for rent + utils, for a tiny 1BR
2019-12-24 06:28:28 <kmc> it's in a nice, though not central location
2019-12-24 06:28:34 <kmc> within san francisco
2019-12-24 06:29:22 <kmc> it's a special place. there are reasons why people are willing to pay so much to live here
2019-12-24 06:32:08 <imode> I'll take your word for that.

2019-12-24 08:40:59 <bunnyocto> halp. I'm continuing an old haskel project and the last change I made was adding a "lift $"
2019-12-24 08:41:03 <bunnyocto> and I have no idea why
2019-12-24 08:41:06 <bunnyocto> and it ain't building :D
2019-12-24 08:41:44 <bunnyocto> It builds without the "lift $"
2019-12-24 08:41:55 <bunnyocto> but for someone reason I added it
2019-12-24 08:42:00 <bunnyocto> and I have no idea why
2019-12-24 08:42:09 <bunnyocto> something had to be broken and I had to try to fix it with a lift
2019-12-24 08:43:18 <bunnyocto> also I added an unsafeInterleaveIO
2019-12-24 08:43:19 <bunnyocto> uhm.
2019-12-24 08:43:23 <bunnyocto> fuck
2019-12-24 08:50:09 <bunnyocto> hm. it seems to not to only build fine it actually seems to work without the lift.
2019-12-24 08:50:11 <bunnyocto> oh nvm then.
2019-12-24 08:50:39 <bunnyocto> so. 1J2q.+C~ produces an infinite fibonacci sequence
