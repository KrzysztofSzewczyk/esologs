2019-12-24 04:05:57 <int-e> fizzie: It turned out to be terribly unfriendly... took me 2 hours to resolve the knot-tying exercise.

2019-12-24 04:57:37 <tswett[m]> Hey, anyone want to hire me? I have five years of professional experience as a software developer, and I'm really, really, really good at math. I'm not interested in software development positions. I'm looking for a salary around $60k.
2019-12-24 04:59:17 User Name: imode = imode!~linear@unaffiliated/imode
2019-12-24 04:59:17 <imode> what position are you looking for exactly.
2019-12-24 04:59:59 <tswett[m]> I don't have an exact position in mind.
2019-12-24 05:00:11 <int-e> Yeah, "not interested" will be the only thing anybody reads in there.
2019-12-24 05:00:32 <int-e> Unfortunately.
2019-12-24 05:01:08 <int-e> Unfortunately we live in a world where people expect you to know what you want :-/
2019-12-24 05:01:17 <imode> if you don't know what you want apply to a FAANG.
2019-12-24 05:02:22 <int-e> Well, what if your ethics aren't flexible enough for that?
2019-12-24 05:03:03 <tswett[m]> int-e: That makes sense.
2019-12-24 05:03:17 <imode> I don't think your average systems engineering job requires ethics that can bend over backwards
2019-12-24 05:03:38 <imode> I work at Amazon. you'd be surprised how mundane this job actually is from every standpoint. we just help people buy ebooks.
2019-12-24 05:04:00 <kmc> i'm giving up on the software industry
2019-12-24 05:04:05 <kmc> i think i'm going to become a mushroom farmer
2019-12-24 05:04:13 <imode> good choice.
2019-12-24 05:04:20 <kmc> we'll see
2019-12-24 05:04:54 <tswett[m]> Yeah, I like that idea.
2019-12-24 05:04:56 <int-e> A hacker's dream, build something from wood... simple and sturdy.
2019-12-24 05:05:15 <int-e> (That's based on a pun that works much better in german.)
2019-12-24 05:05:30 <imode> build your own computing ecosystem.
2019-12-24 05:06:24 <tswett[m]> I like that idea too.
2019-12-24 05:06:54 <imode> are you in desperate need of a job.
2019-12-24 05:06:54 <tswett[m]> I think I'm going to dogfood an operating system for the original IBM PC.
2019-12-24 05:07:20 <tswett[m]> Yes.
2019-12-24 05:07:34 <imode> what are your skills and where are you located.
2019-12-24 05:09:02 <tswett[m]> Well, I have experience in plenty of programming languages: C#, Perl, SQL, and bits of C++, HTML, JavaScript, Rust, and VBA.
2019-12-24 05:09:26 <zzo38> If you will make a operating system for the original IBM PC, then maybe you should use x86 assembly language.
2019-12-24 05:09:29 <imode> got any examples of things you've built with these tools.
2019-12-24 05:09:41 <imode> any past work experience.
2019-12-24 05:09:43 <tswett[m]> I have a degree in math and knowledge of bits and pieces here and there. I like Haskell and category theory.
2019-12-24 05:10:03 <tswett[m]> Yeah, here's the flight simulator autopilot I wrote in C#. https://github.com/tswett/WarrigalsAutopilot
2019-12-24 05:10:18 <tswett[m]> I have several professional software development positions.
2019-12-24 05:10:28 <imode> such as.
2019-12-24 05:11:08 <tswett[m]> Diagnosed and fixed issues with a large variety of production software for Priority Health, the health insurance arm of Spectrum Health.
2019-12-24 05:11:27 <tswett[m]> Wrote desktop application software for the ‚ÄúeXact‚Äù line of color measurement instruments using both C# and C++.
2019-12-24 05:11:30 <tswett[m]> That kind of stuff :D
2019-12-24 05:12:25 <imode> neat. do you have any idea of the roles/duties you'd like to take on at your next position.
2019-12-24 05:13:59 <shachaf> zzo38: Which assembly syntax should I use?
2019-12-24 05:14:02 <shachaf> Or should I make my own?
2019-12-24 05:16:07 <zzo38> shachaf: I don't know. Depend what assembler software you use, I suppose. Make up your own if you do not like that one.
2019-12-24 05:17:59 <tswett[m]> imode: Vaguely. I'd like to be an actuary (for one); I'd like to compile and analyze data in order to make calculations related to financial risk.
2019-12-24 05:18:26 <imode> so find actuary positions.
2019-12-24 05:19:52 <tswett[m]> I'm working on it.
2019-12-24 05:20:12 <kmc> there are/were a number of banks that use Haskell for modelling financial contracts
2019-12-24 05:20:30 <kmc> so perhaps you could get a job which isn't just programming, but utilizes your programming skills
2019-12-24 05:21:06 <kmc> int-e: what's the german pun?
2019-12-24 05:23:39 <tswett[m]> That does sound interesting.
2019-12-24 05:25:31 <kmc> thinking about work makes me sad
2019-12-24 05:25:38 <int-e> kmc: There's "hacken" meaning to chop wood.
2019-12-24 05:26:00 <int-e> Arguably not much of a pun.
2019-12-24 05:26:02 <imode> kmc: you retired?
2019-12-24 05:26:10 <kmc> i used to love programming but 10 years of working in the tech industry while struggling with mental health problems killed that :/
2019-12-24 05:26:28 <kmc> i flamed out
2019-12-24 05:26:34 <shachaf> I'm kittensitting this week. It's so good.
2019-12-24 05:26:36 <kmc> my spouse supports me financially
2019-12-24 05:26:41 <imode> oof.
2019-12-24 05:26:52 <imode> what happened, if you don't mind me asking?
2019-12-24 05:27:03 <int-e> shachaf: cushions are less messy
2019-12-24 05:27:09 <shachaf> I quit my job a longish time ago and haven't mustered up the whatever to get another one.
2019-12-24 05:27:18 <shachaf> Maybe I'll do that at one point?
2019-12-24 05:27:32 <imode> you must have quite a bit of savings or financial cushion.
2019-12-24 05:27:53 <tswett[m]> One option is to, instead of getting another job, just retire now and live off of $90 a month.
2019-12-24 05:27:54 <kmc> imode: it's a long story and not one i wish to retell at this moment
2019-12-24 05:28:08 <kmc> I had savings, not so much anymore
2019-12-24 05:28:12 <kmc> like I said, my spouse supports me
2019-12-24 05:28:21 <imode> kmc: that was moreso directed at shachaf, sorry.
2019-12-24 05:28:26 <imode> the last message, I mean.
2019-12-24 05:28:26 <kmc> oh, sorry
2019-12-24 05:28:32 <imode> you're good. :)
2019-12-24 05:28:33 <kmc> i have shachaf on /ignore
2019-12-24 05:28:38 <imode> oof.
2019-12-24 05:28:41 <shachaf> I suspected as much.
2019-12-24 05:28:45 <kmc> that is also a long story i don't wish to retell
2019-12-24 05:28:58 <kmc> :(
2019-12-24 05:29:11 <int-e> `? shachaf
2019-12-24 05:29:13 <HackEso> Queen Shachaf of the Dawn spr¯ som selleri and cosplays Nepeta Leijon on weekends. He hates bell peppers with a passion. He doesn't know when to stop asking questions. We don't like this.
2019-12-24 05:29:22 <kmc> int-e: I get the pun now, thanks
2019-12-24 05:29:30 <shachaf> I am also sad now.
2019-12-24 05:29:42 <kmc> it works in english, once you know what it's supposed to be
2019-12-24 05:29:47 <tswett[m]> I like everyone.
2019-12-24 05:30:01 <tswett[m]> What's mine...
