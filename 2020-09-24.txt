2020-09-24 00:04:18 <b_jonas> wait... so in debian, when software documentation is in a separate binary package, if it's html (or pdf) documentation (as opposed to man pages or info), the documentation is usually installed under /usr/share/doc . but /usr/share/doc has directories for each binary package name, and the docs are sometimes installed under the name of the doc package, but sometimes under the name of the software package.

2020-09-24 00:09:24 <zzo38> What are the policies for documentation in Debian?
2020-09-24 00:09:42 <esowiki> 14[[07Alex14]]4 10 02https://esolangs.org/w/index.php?diff=77725&oldid=50296 5* 03BougeToi 5* (-9) 10Made the text more adjacent to English
2020-09-24 00:10:25 <zzo38> If there is documentation which isn't in man pages, presumably I should think the man pages should mention where to find them, though. (In addition to HTML and PDF, some programs may also have plain text documentation.)

2020-09-24 00:21:10 <fizzie> If it's a mistake, I think it's a pretty common mistake. Unless you meant "mistake" in the sense of "not a good idea", rather than "not a thing a Debian package is supposed to do".

2020-09-24 00:25:08 <fizzie> I guess it might be just that there's no one consistent convention. One of the '-doc' packages I've got installed (gpsbabel-doc) in fact puts meta-documentation about the doc package (changelog.Debian.gz, copyright) in /usr/share/doc/gpsbabel-doc, but documentation about the software itself (gpsbabel.html, gpsbabel.pdf.gz) in /usr/share/doc/gpsbabel. And then it makes /usr/share/doc/gpsbabel-doc/doc a
2020-09-24 00:25:14 <fizzie> symlink to '../gpsbabel'.
2020-09-24 00:25:29 <fizzie> But maybe that's just a particularly weird example.

2020-09-24 00:58:31 <b_jonas> zzo38: some programs also have info documentation. I don't know what the policies are, but the practice that I observe is that they mostly just let you install docs in the form that the upstream could install, which could be any of man, info, html, pdf; and then also add at least stub manpages for executables if they don't have one.
2020-09-24 00:59:07 <b_jonas> they change the installation directories, but that make sense, they have to change that for basically everything they install.
2020-09-24 00:59:38 <b_jonas> and most software already allows or should allow users to decide the installation directories anyway.
2020-09-24 01:01:12 <b_jonas> zzo38: oh, and also if the documentation is licensed under the GFDL with front or back cover text, then they consider that docs not free and so don't put them in the main archives. this is sort of internally consistent, but very annoying.
2020-09-24 01:07:54 <zzo38> O, yes, there is also info documentation
2020-09-24 01:58:54 User Name: spruit11 = spruit11!~unknown@86-82-44-193.fixed.kpn.net
2020-09-24 01:58:54 <spruit11> For what is this? If I remember correctly there are tools to generate man and info pages from your application if you set it up correctly.
2020-09-24 01:59:49 <zzo38> I have used .ds and .so commands so that you can specify what directories other files are found in (whether documentation or something else) edited by the distributor, separately from the rest of the man page.
2020-09-24 01:59:57 <b_jonas> zzo38: also a few programs, most notably subversionn, hide their reference documentation in the executable such that you can access them with something like program-name help --verbose then program-name help subcommand-or-doc-section
2020-09-24 02:00:12 <zzo38> Yes, some programs do.
2020-09-24 02:01:33 <b_jonas> zzo38: I should go through and extract all the help pages from the programs of subversion (svn, svnadmin, and a few more) and concatenate them to a single searchable text file, but so far I've been lazy
2020-09-24 02:02:08 <b_jonas> mercurial also does this, but it also comes with a hg(1) manpage that has the same text, so in that case it's fine
2020-09-24 02:02:26 <b_jonas> svn doesn't have that text in man-pages or on the web or anywhere easily searchable
2020-09-24 02:02:49 <b_jonas> fossil also has the docs in the executable
2020-09-24 02:03:14 <b_jonas> zzo38: do you happen to have already existed these docs for some executable such that you can share?
2020-09-24 02:04:18 <zzo38> Yes, I know fossil does too
2020-09-24 02:04:51 <zzo38> b_jonas: I am not sure what you are looking for
2020-09-24 02:05:54 <b_jonas> zzo38: a single text file that contains all possible outputs from svn help $anything, svnadmin help $anything, etc; and similarly for fossil help $anything
2020-09-24 02:06:13 <b_jonas> because in a text file, I can do full-text search
2020-09-24 02:06:19 <zzo38> I do not have them.

2020-09-24 02:52:54 <b_jonas> this is probably a stupid question because I don't understand enough about hardware. ethernet uses a checksum, usually crc32 or crc16, to detect packages that aren't transmitted correctly, and can use that to negotiate transmission speed. that much makes sense. but why doesn't ethernet also use some kind of error-correction code, to gain bandwith?
2020-09-24 02:53:25 <b_jonas> at least optionally I mean, after negotiation.

2020-09-24 02:55:37 <b_jonas> you can't really add error correction codes at higher layers of the protocol if ethernet discards packets with wrong checksums
2020-09-24 02:55:48 <b_jonas> so it's ethernet that has to do it
