2019-12-03 00:05:23 <imode-ruby> sorry, should've clarified what I meant by "commands". bot commands are fine. controlling the bot via PRIVMSG is.. not fine.
2019-12-03 00:08:55 <fizzie> AIUI, it wasn't really a matter of controlling the bot through any sort of intended control commands, more tricking it into messaging things to NickServ.
2019-12-03 00:09:23 <imode-ruby> mhm. if you can PRIVMSG anything, you can hijack it.

2019-12-03 00:36:34 <fizzie> BT has this thing called "InLinkUK", it's like a digital advertising sign they've installed on sidewalks + free wifi access point + some sort of tablet you can use in kiosk mode for "information". Except it had crashed, and the advertising screen was saying "Ubuntu 15.04 adl-uk-002661 tty1" and "adl-uk-002661 login: _"
2019-12-03 00:39:03 <fizzie> I like it when screens like this are showing things they shouldn't be showing.

2019-12-03 02:14:16 <fizzie> Do you actually need `t for 5 w?
2019-12-03 02:15:05 <oerjan> shachaf: it's shorter if ` is a dead key, because then `u = ˘ but `t isn't a special combination (at least on my keyboard)

2019-12-03 02:16:48 <fizzie> IMO, with a compose key, compose-`-? should compose ` onto absolutely anything, using a COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT. But it doesn't, here.

2019-12-03 02:18:11 <fizzie> I don't really know. Though I can type a tÃÄ by starting with a t, then holding down ctrl-shift and typing 0300. But that's the urxvt code point entry feature.
