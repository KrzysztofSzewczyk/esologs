2019-12-03 00:05:23 <imode-ruby> sorry, should've clarified what I meant by "commands". bot commands are fine. controlling the bot via PRIVMSG is.. not fine.
2019-12-03 00:08:55 <fizzie> AIUI, it wasn't really a matter of controlling the bot through any sort of intended control commands, more tricking it into messaging things to NickServ.
2019-12-03 00:09:23 <imode-ruby> mhm. if you can PRIVMSG anything, you can hijack it.

2019-12-03 00:36:34 <fizzie> BT has this thing called "InLinkUK", it's like a digital advertising sign they've installed on sidewalks + free wifi access point + some sort of tablet you can use in kiosk mode for "information". Except it had crashed, and the advertising screen was saying "Ubuntu 15.04 adl-uk-002661 tty1" and "adl-uk-002661 login: _"

2019-12-03 04:10:58 <oerjan> admittedly the bot probably needs to be kept off until fixed.
2019-12-03 04:12:26 <oerjan> b_jonas: you could have phrased that a lot less confrontational, though.
2019-12-03 04:12:32 <zzo38> If you do not try to register it, I do not have a problem with it since if they want to register it themself then they can do so and use NS GHOST to force a disconnect
2019-12-03 04:12:50 <oerjan> zzo38: except that's exactly what he did
2019-12-03 04:13:30 <zzo38> Yes, but I think that isn't what should be done. Instead just use a persistent connection, I think, is better
2019-12-03 04:14:20 <oerjan> zzo38: i am confused what problem you are thinking that solves
2019-12-03 04:14:47 <oerjan> the problem is that bfbot was online, completely abusable, and its owner wasn't.
2019-12-03 04:15:35 <oerjan> and b_jonas used its abusability to get it disconnected.
2019-12-03 04:15:57 <oerjan> by a method which required him registering it. i'm not sure whether another would have worked.
2019-12-03 04:16:11 <zzo38> Would it work to only temporarily register it?
2019-12-03 04:16:18 <zzo38> If so, then that is what should be done.
2019-12-03 04:16:47 <oerjan> oh he also set nick protection to prevent it from reconnecting, i think.
2019-12-03 04:17:27 <oerjan> which is the thing that cannot be done temporarily, i guess.
2019-12-03 04:18:18 <zzo38> If it automatically reconnects, that isn't your fault. If it tries to rejoin the channel, then you can add a ban and then remove it later. If it does a wrong thing by a private message, filter them out on your client. Other than that, I think just leave it.
2019-12-03 04:19:02 <oerjan> zzo38: the thing is that it was so abusable that a person could use it against a third party
2019-12-03 04:19:23 <zzo38> That isn't up to you, though. Just let it; the third party can filter it out themself if they do not want it.
2019-12-03 04:19:57 <zzo38> But if you are really concerned, I suppose notify the server operator they can decide whether or not to do anything about it.
2019-12-03 04:19:58 <oerjan> also, it was on #esoteric-blah which has no ops
2019-12-03 04:20:15 <zzo38> If it is a channel with no ops then just it be on there.
2019-12-03 04:20:22 <oerjan> (well, it has staff so we could ask FireFly i guess)
2019-12-03 04:21:40 <oerjan> oh wait it's freenode-staff which isn't the same thing.
2019-12-03 04:22:34 <oerjan> (just a dummy account to hold channels i think)
2019-12-03 04:24:34 <zzo38> I think you should not interfere other people's channel if it can be use on a channel that has no ops then it should just let be on there, and if you do not want to receive their messages then you can filter in the client side. If it causes problems with the server, then the server operator should learn about it in order to remove it.
2019-12-03 04:24:55 <oerjan> @tell kspalaiologos I see b_jonas may have gone a bit too far to quit your bot. it was _really_ unsecure though (which is how he could).
2019-12-03 04:24:55 <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
