2019-12-03 00:05:23 <imode-ruby> sorry, should've clarified what I meant by "commands". bot commands are fine. controlling the bot via PRIVMSG is.. not fine.
2019-12-03 00:08:55 <fizzie> AIUI, it wasn't really a matter of controlling the bot through any sort of intended control commands, more tricking it into messaging things to NickServ.
2019-12-03 00:09:23 <imode-ruby> mhm. if you can PRIVMSG anything, you can hijack it.

2019-12-03 00:36:34 <fizzie> BT has this thing called "InLinkUK", it's like a digital advertising sign they've installed on sidewalks + free wifi access point + some sort of tablet you can use in kiosk mode for "information". Except it had crashed, and the advertising screen was saying "Ubuntu 15.04 adl-uk-002661 tty1" and "adl-uk-002661 login: _"

2019-12-03 04:10:58 <oerjan> admittedly the bot probably needs to be kept off until fixed.
2019-12-03 04:12:26 <oerjan> b_jonas: you could have phrased that a lot less confrontational, though.
2019-12-03 04:12:32 <zzo38> If you do not try to register it, I do not have a problem with it since if they want to register it themself then they can do so and use NS GHOST to force a disconnect
2019-12-03 04:12:50 <oerjan> zzo38: except that's exactly what he did
2019-12-03 04:13:30 <zzo38> Yes, but I think that isn't what should be done. Instead just use a persistent connection, I think, is better
2019-12-03 04:14:20 <oerjan> zzo38: i am confused what problem you are thinking that solves
2019-12-03 04:14:47 <oerjan> the problem is that bfbot was online, completely abusable, and its owner wasn't.
2019-12-03 04:15:35 <oerjan> and b_jonas used its abusability to get it disconnected.
2019-12-03 04:15:57 <oerjan> by a method which required him registering it. i'm not sure whether another would have worked.
2019-12-03 04:16:11 <zzo38> Would it work to only temporarily register it?
2019-12-03 04:16:18 <zzo38> If so, then that is what should be done.
2019-12-03 04:16:47 <oerjan> oh he also set nick protection to prevent it from reconnecting, i think.
2019-12-03 04:17:27 <oerjan> which is the thing that cannot be done temporarily, i guess.
2019-12-03 04:18:18 <zzo38> If it automatically reconnects, that isn't your fault. If it tries to rejoin the channel, then you can add a ban and then remove it later. If it does a wrong thing by a private message, filter them out on your client. Other than that, I think just leave it.
2019-12-03 04:19:02 <oerjan> zzo38: the thing is that it was so abusable that a person could use it against a third party
2019-12-03 04:19:23 <zzo38> That isn't up to you, though. Just let it; the third party can filter it out themself if they do not want it.
2019-12-03 04:19:57 <zzo38> But if you are really concerned, I suppose notify the server operator they can decide whether or not to do anything about it.
2019-12-03 04:19:58 <oerjan> also, it was on #esoteric-blah which has no ops
2019-12-03 04:20:15 <zzo38> If it is a channel with no ops then just it be on there.
2019-12-03 04:20:22 <oerjan> (well, it has staff so we could ask FireFly i guess)
2019-12-03 04:21:40 <oerjan> oh wait it's freenode-staff which isn't the same thing.
2019-12-03 04:22:34 <oerjan> (just a dummy account to hold channels i think)
2019-12-03 04:24:34 <zzo38> I think you should not interfere other people's channel if it can be use on a channel that has no ops then it should just let be on there, and if you do not want to receive their messages then you can filter in the client side. If it causes problems with the server, then the server operator should learn about it in order to remove it.
2019-12-03 04:24:55 <oerjan> @tell kspalaiologos I see b_jonas may have gone a bit too far to quit your bot. it was _really_ unsecure though (which is how he could).
2019-12-03 04:24:55 <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
2019-12-03 04:25:59 <oerjan> trying some de-escalation

2019-12-03 05:25:27 <zzo38> I think is strange that the /proc/*/fd/* pretend to be symlinks but don't really work like symlinks. It seem like it would be like a "special link" instead?
2019-12-03 05:27:55 <kmc> in what way don't they act like symlinks?
2019-12-03 05:28:27 <zzo38> I think they can refer to deleted files and to anonymous stuff, and symlinks can't
2019-12-03 05:28:32 <kmc> is it because they may refer to anonymous things?
2019-12-03 05:28:33 <kmc> right
2019-12-03 05:29:10 <kmc> keegan@localhost:~$ ls -l /proc/self/fd | grep pipe
2019-12-03 05:29:10 <kmc> l-wx------ 1 keegan keegan 64 Dec  2 21:29 1 -> pipe:[6737388]
2019-12-03 05:29:15 <kmc> wonder what that number means
2019-12-03 05:29:17 <shachaf> Can you distinguish between a deleted file and a link to a file ending in ' (deleted)'?
2019-12-03 05:29:24 <kmc> lolol
2019-12-03 05:29:32 <kmc> you mean without a race condition?
2019-12-03 05:29:40 <shachaf> I mean at all, I think?
2019-12-03 05:30:03 <kmc> well you could try to readlink then open
2019-12-03 05:30:04 <shachaf> If you have a program that opens /foo, and you delete foo, /proc/pid/fd/n will be a link to '/foo (deleted)'
2019-12-03 05:30:10 <kmc> but I guess you may have both files
2019-12-03 05:30:17 <kmc> both '/foo' and '/foo (deleted)'
2019-12-03 05:30:23 <shachaf> But how can you tell whether a program just opened a file with that name?
2019-12-03 05:30:35 <shachaf> Ugh, I hate how much of UNIX is stringly typed.
2019-12-03 05:30:42 <shachaf> The whole /proc thing is a mess.
2019-12-03 05:30:57 <kmc> does  stat /proc/$PID/fd/$N  tell you anything useful?
2019-12-03 05:30:57 <kmc> yes
2019-12-03 05:31:05 <kmc> /proc isn't even UNIX
2019-12-03 05:31:19 <kmc> it's a linux thing intended for quick hacks in kernel development that just grew and grew
2019-12-03 05:31:20 <shachaf> Well, that's fair.
2019-12-03 05:31:25 <shachaf> How did ps work back in the day?
2019-12-03 05:31:32 <kmc> BSD also has /proc but there's not like a standard for what's in these things
2019-12-03 05:31:40 <kmc> i think it even has a linux-emulating procfs as well
2019-12-03 05:31:48 <shachaf> There isn't a POSIX-style standard, but that's not what I care about.
2019-12-03 05:31:50 <kmc> i think by parsing /dev/mem
2019-12-03 05:31:52 <kmc> really.
2019-12-03 05:32:03 <kmc> and so ps was setuid
2019-12-03 05:32:26 <shachaf> The annoying thing is that even if I port my program specifically to Linux, I have this terrible ABI.
2019-12-03 05:32:41 <shachaf> The system call ABI is pretty good. Things like ioctls are OK? And /proc is a mess.
2019-12-03 05:32:46 <zzo38> There are problems with /proc, although I think it is because they treat the files in it as files and symlinks and so on even though it isn't like that. Add a new type for "special entries" and then you can avoid such problem.
2019-12-03 05:32:59 <shachaf> And that's not to mention the userspace ABI, which involves parsing things like /etc/passwd and /etc/resolv.conf which are sort of specified.
2019-12-03 05:33:16 <kmc> ioctls are not okay
2019-12-03 05:33:34 <kmc> ioctls are like syscalls only with minimal oversight on whether they are at all well-designed
2019-12-03 05:34:05 <shachaf> Sure, but at least they have an ABI at all, generally.
2019-12-03 05:34:20 <shachaf> Instead of parsing text which was mostly meant for debugging.
2019-12-03 05:34:44 <shachaf> kmc: Do you like io_uring?

2019-12-03 05:36:38 <kmc> what's that
2019-12-03 05:36:46 <shachaf> I don't see anything different from stat.
2019-12-03 05:37:05 <shachaf> Maybe you can open the file and fstat it and compare the inodes or something.
2019-12-03 05:37:20 <shachaf> It's the new Linux asynchronous I/O API.
2019-12-03 05:37:28 <shachaf> and maybe asynchronous everything API??
2019-12-03 05:37:32 <kmc> ok

2019-12-03 05:37:59 <shachaf> You have a request and response ring buffer, and you send the kernel requests and get responses.
2019-12-03 05:38:21 <shachaf> If you can send it requests fast enough, you might never have transitions to ring 0 at all.
2019-12-03 05:38:35 <shachaf> You write to your buffer in your thread and it reads in its thread on another core.

2019-12-03 05:44:53 <kmc> yeah
2019-12-03 05:45:02 <kmc> but you can also call into the kernel to block on it?
2019-12-03 05:45:19 <kmc> this is how high performance network drivers have worked forever
2019-12-03 05:45:33 <kmc> if you're doing low latency infiniband or something on linux then you don't go through the kernel at all
2019-12-03 05:45:42 <kmc> you write into a ring buffer in the card's address space
2019-12-03 05:46:29 <shachaf> You can also call into the kernel, yep.
2019-12-03 05:46:52 <shachaf> This is the reasonable way for things to work, obviously.

2019-12-03 07:54:34 <kmc> shachaf: historical reasons
2019-12-03 07:54:55 <kmc> the language was designed around value types / unboxed objects / whatever you want to call them
2019-12-03 07:55:10 <kmc> but they hadn't worked out that move semantics are the way to make that work nicely
2019-12-03 07:55:42 <kmc> moves + an explicit clone() method seems much nicer to me
2019-12-03 07:55:50 <kmc> though this depends on a certain return-value optimization
2019-12-03 07:55:57 <kmc> but everything in C++ depends on optimization for good performance
2019-12-03 07:56:47 <kmc> there are probably some cases where the copy constructor performs better
2019-12-03 07:56:52 <kmc> at least, i think there are some cases for operator=
2019-12-03 07:57:00 <kmc> which is a closely related concept
2019-12-03 07:57:05 Quit: tromp (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
2019-12-03 07:57:15 <kmc> but operator= has an old object to (partially) dispose of, and Foo(const Foo&) doesn't
2019-12-03 07:57:39 <kmc> all this is setting aside the question of whether overloadable *move* constructors are also a mistake
2019-12-03 07:57:48 <kmc> which I think is much more debatable
2019-12-03 07:58:05 <shachaf> Man, everything about the STL is scow.

2019-12-03 07:58:16 <shachaf> Every time I try to understand what's going on there I'm miserable.
2019-12-03 07:58:46 <kmc> Rust has no operator= overloading, if you assign into a variable whose type has a destructor, then the whole thing is destroyed before the new value is moved in
2019-12-03 07:58:47 <shachaf> And the specification requires things to be low-performance. And the implemetations aren't predictable or fast.
2019-12-03 07:58:52 <kmc> which is plausibly less efficient in some cases, I guess
2019-12-03 07:59:05 <kmc> but I'm not sure how often anyone writes an operator= which does such things
2019-12-03 07:59:33 <shachaf> That sounds pretty plausible. Maybe an even more plausible thing would be to do away with destructors entirely.
2019-12-03 08:00:00 <kmc> then how will I have RAII?
