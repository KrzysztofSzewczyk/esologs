2019-12-03 00:05:23 <imode-ruby> sorry, should've clarified what I meant by "commands". bot commands are fine. controlling the bot via PRIVMSG is.. not fine.
2019-12-03 00:08:55 <fizzie> AIUI, it wasn't really a matter of controlling the bot through any sort of intended control commands, more tricking it into messaging things to NickServ.
2019-12-03 00:09:23 <imode-ruby> mhm. if you can PRIVMSG anything, you can hijack it.
