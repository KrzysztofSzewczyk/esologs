2020-08-12 00:01:11 <tswett[m]> Do you mean make it so that all algorithms require an infinite amount of memory?
2020-08-12 00:01:56 <tswett[m]> Or do you mean make it so that there's a particular amount of memory such that if less than that much memory is available, no algorithms can be implemented?
2020-08-12 00:02:27 <tswett[m]> Or do you mean make it so that there's a particular amount of memory such that if an algorithm requires less than that much memory, then it cannot be implemented?
2020-08-12 00:07:02 <tswett[m]> I'm guessing you meant the first of those.
