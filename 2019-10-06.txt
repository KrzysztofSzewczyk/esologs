2019-10-06 03:17:03 * oerjan carefully sidles away from his own brain
2019-10-06 03:19:17 * pikhq notes that personal pronouns tend to be, well, important to people
2019-10-06 03:19:35 * oerjan agrees with qwwem
2019-10-06 03:21:19 <pikhq> Who?
2019-10-06 03:21:28 <oerjan> with you
2019-10-06 03:21:33 <pikhq> -_-
2019-10-06 03:22:27 * oerjan may not have sidled far enough
2019-10-06 03:22:58 <pikhq> Let's just say that was rather rude of you and leave it at that
2019-10-06 03:23:43 <oerjan> my brain has trouble thinking of pronouns seriously now
2019-10-06 03:26:45 <oerjan> but i've been half thinking that the sane long-term solution for english is for everyone to standardize on they/them/their, which make your protest against it sort of a mind whiplash. although i can understand how it can still be rude if someone uses it _only_ for non-cis gendered people
2019-10-06 03:26:56 <oerjan> *makes
2019-10-06 03:28:06 <kmc> yeah
2019-10-06 03:28:22 <kmc> that is the main case where 'they' would bother me
2019-10-06 03:28:30 <pikhq> ^
2019-10-06 03:28:39 <zzo38> I sometimes use "they" for anyone, regardless of who they are, anyways
2019-10-06 03:28:53 <kmc> i think i'd be okay with someone who used 'they' for everyone
2019-10-06 03:29:03 <kmc> although the last time this actually came up, I was not okay with it
2019-10-06 03:29:04 <pikhq> Really a matter of context making me go "uuuuh"
2019-10-06 03:29:19 <kmc> but that's for complicated reasons arising from personal trauma and i wasn't really being fair to that person anyway
2019-10-06 03:31:12 <kmc> it took me a long time to accept that it's okay to think in principle that gender is stupid and should go away, and yet to be assertive about my own gender identity
2019-10-06 03:31:20 <kmc> it's one of those ideal world vs real world things
2019-10-06 03:32:28 <kmc> the whole thing has been really humbling as far as learning what i can and can't change about myself
2019-10-06 03:33:05 <kmc> transitioning is a huge change but it's something we do because we *can't* change who we really are
2019-10-06 03:33:40 <pikhq> At a certain point you just get done pretending to be someone else.
2019-10-06 03:33:45 <kmc> yeah
2019-10-06 03:34:16 <kmc> I think most trans people would much prefer to take a magic pill that makes you happy with your birth gender, but it doesn't exist
2019-10-06 03:34:38 <kmc> I don't think I would take that pill, personally
2019-10-06 03:34:53 <kmc> (which ironically? makes me "fake trans" to a lot of people, because they can only see this experience through the lens of misery)
2019-10-06 03:35:04 <pikhq> It sounds easier. But at the same time, that's a radical change in who you are as a person.
2019-10-06 03:35:05 <kmc> i mean for one I think that pill would have to change my personality a whole lot
2019-10-06 03:35:15 <kmc> and also well, being trans /is/ very interesting
2019-10-06 03:35:33 <kmc> and like I'm in a pretty good position to transition compared to most
2019-10-06 03:35:51 <kmc> and I'm some sort of extreme neophile
2019-10-06 03:35:53 <kmc> and i've always been a transhumanist
2019-10-06 03:36:10 * pikhq is honestly a big ol' scaredy cat :P
2019-10-06 03:36:18 <kmc> lol
2019-10-06 03:36:19 <kmc> I'm both
2019-10-06 03:36:29 <kmc> like, it was really hard for me to start making permanent changes to my body
2019-10-06 03:36:34 <kmc> which is v. ironic
2019-10-06 03:36:44 <zzo38> Sometimes it isn't clear if you mean singular or plural, so then you shouldn't use "they" (or sometimes also "you", which is also grammatically plural but can also be used singular).
2019-10-06 03:36:55 <pikhq> Y'know what's hard? _Shopping_.
2019-10-06 03:37:19 <pikhq> zzo38: In such a case it's probably simplest to just rephrase to avoid the use of a pronoun.
2019-10-06 03:37:24 <zzo38> (Fortunately, Wizards of the Coast considered that ambiguity when making that change in Magic: the Gathering, so that the ambiguity is avoided.)
2019-10-06 03:37:31 <pikhq> Said cases aren't very common, but that's basic writing, ain't it?
2019-10-06 03:37:47 <zzo38> pikhq: Yes, that is correct, and is what is done in Magic: the Gathering in those few cases.

2019-10-06 03:38:16 <zzo38> (Although there are different ways of doing so. The rules for Magic: the Gathering say "that player" is used if "they" is ambiguous.)
2019-10-06 03:38:35 <pikhq> Reasonable within that context.
2019-10-06 03:38:43 <zzo38> Yes, in that context, it is reasonable.
2019-10-06 03:38:49 <zzo38> In other contexts, there is other ways.
2019-10-06 03:39:05 <pikhq> e.g. if it's ambiguous in other cases you can just use someone's name.
2019-10-06 03:39:27 <pikhq> Like you would if there's multiple "he"s or "she"s and you need to be clear who you're talking about.
2019-10-06 03:39:34 <zzo38> Yes, in the cases where their name is known (and not itself ambiguous, which in rare cases it can be).
2019-10-06 03:39:46 <pikhq> Language!
2019-10-06 03:39:56 <pikhq> Always so fuzzy around the edges
2019-10-06 03:41:24 <zzo38> I have no problem with singular "they", but I don't like singular "themselves". (The singular should be "themself", like for "you", it will be "yourself" as singular rather than "yourselves", I think.)
2019-10-06 03:42:10 <pikhq> I think the jury's out on which one is the grammatical one there.
2019-10-06 03:42:37 <zzo38> pikhq: Yes, those language always so fuzzy around the edges, is also one of the reason why I don't like Inform7 so much, and also a reason for why I have thought to have a AST-based format for the effect of Magic: the Gathering cards.
2019-10-06 03:43:18 <zzo38> pikhq: Yes, people use both, although I personally don't like to write "themselves" if it is singular.
2019-10-06 03:43:36 * pikhq shrugs
2019-10-06 03:44:20 <pikhq> "Themselves" still sounds cleaner to my internal sense of things, but that's probably nothing more than pattern matching doing weird things.
2019-10-06 03:44:59 <zzo38> Yes, probably, I think
2019-10-06 03:45:36 <zzo38> (That is probably why many people use that, I think)
2019-10-06 03:45:38 <pikhq> Honestly, I still have a soft spot in my heart for Spivak pronouns.
2019-10-06 03:51:24 <kmc> yeah
2019-10-06 03:51:26 <kmc> well, we'll see
2019-10-06 03:51:38 <kmc> right now it's hard enough to get people to accept singular 'they'
2019-10-06 03:51:51 <kmc> even though it goes back to shakespeare if not earlier
2019-10-06 03:53:04 <kmc> pikhq: you don't like shopping?
2019-10-06 03:53:35 <pikhq> Though there is one (honestly minor) difference between historical and modern use. Historical singular "they" was for an indefinite referent; modern singular "they" extends to definite ones.
2019-10-06 03:54:00 <kmc> pikhq: meaning that the use to refer to a specific person is new?
2019-10-06 03:54:03 <pikhq> kmc: I like shopping, and since I'm still boy-mode much of the time, am terrified of being caught in public doing so
2019-10-06 03:54:04 <pikhq> Yes
2019-10-06 04:15:36 <zzo38> I have a few question about conlang. One is if you have made fonts for constructed languages (with METAFONT or otherwise; for printer fonts I would probably use METAFONT if I were doing so)? Do some involve sounds not in IPA or X-SAMPA? Are there some with multiple mouth? Are there some with unusual writing directions (e.g. circular or 3D)?
2019-10-06 04:16:35 <zzo38> There is also Z-SAMPA, but might any involve stuff not in Z-SAMPA? What effects might physiology have on phonology?
2019-10-06 04:17:14 <kmc> pikhq: ah, I see
2019-10-06 04:17:31 <zzo38> I noticed that Z-SAMPA uses some Italian words that are used in musical notation.
2019-10-06 04:17:55 <pikhq> zzo38: I've never done so, but this is an interesting thing to think about.
2019-10-06 04:18:13 <pikhq> A conlang for non-human physiology seems like a space ripe for some interesting experiments.
2019-10-06 04:18:45 <kmc> pikhq: a nice thing happened to me today
2019-10-06 04:18:55 <kmc> I helped a guy use the parking meter in my neighborhood and he said "wow, you're tall!" several times and at the end thanked me for being a "nice girl"
2019-10-06 04:19:03 <pikhq> Aww. :)
2019-10-06 04:19:34 <kmc> and I didn't even put in particular effort today to look female
2019-10-06 04:19:42 <kmc> i was wearing jeans and a men's cut T-shirt
2019-10-06 04:20:55 <kmc> so apparently the other stuff (hair, glasses, jewelry, tits?) is enough to overcome the fact that I'm a really really tall woman, at least for some
2019-10-06 04:21:14 <kmc> (6'3", specifically)
2019-10-06 04:21:33 <pikhq> I mean, if being tall were a problem my entire family would have issues.
2019-10-06 04:21:40 <pikhq> My mom's 5'10". She's the short one.
2019-10-06 04:21:55 <kmc> it doesn't help, but it's not a dealbreaker
2019-10-06 04:25:20 <zzo38> I looked at information about Z-SAMPA, and they mention alternative non-ASCII characters for 8-bit character sets, although there are different 8-bit character sets so you may wish to do differently, such as PC character set.
2019-10-06 04:26:05 <zzo38> (Another possibility might be a variant with colours.)
2019-10-06 04:27:46 <zzo38> About non-human physiology, one thing I thought is that colour words might be untranslatable (although that is a separate issue from phonology, but it is still a part of the language).
2019-10-06 04:28:41 * pikhq nods
2019-10-06 04:28:54 <pikhq> In some cases, only translatable by analogy I suppose.
2019-10-06 04:29:35 <zzo38> Yes
2019-10-06 04:31:06 <pikhq> Though in truth -- color words are sometimes hard to translate even from human languages.
2019-10-06 04:32:00 <zzo38> Yes, although in the case I am describing it is even more difficult, I think.
2019-10-06 04:33:00 <pikhq> I imagine you're thinking of a species that either has a wider vision range, or (even more difficult) has a vision range that doesn't overlap with ours.
2019-10-06 04:33:26 <zzo38> I found a article on Wikipedia about untranslatability.
2019-10-06 04:33:34 <pikhq> Though even just having different sensitivity peaks within our vision range probably does odd things to color perception.
2019-10-06 04:33:49 <zzo38> pikhq: Yes, the former; I didn't think of the latter although of course there is that too.
2019-10-06 04:40:51 <zzo38> pikhq: I didn't think of that either, but that is also a good point.
