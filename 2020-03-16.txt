2020-03-16 01:13:44 <zzo38> ZZT itself is now Free software (the source code has been reconstructed), but you will still need Turbo Pascal to compile it, so it is still "trapped". You will also need LZEXE. Doing this allegedly produces the same ZZT.EXE file as the original; the only difference may be how the source code is formatted, and the comments and possibly variable names and so on.

2020-03-16 01:19:16 <int-e> zzo38: didn't Borland make the Pascal compiler free at some point? Or do you need a specific older version?
2020-03-16 01:21:11 <int-e> (that's free as in beer, though)
2020-03-16 01:22:04 <zzo38> Yes, it is freeware now, but not free software. (Still, it is a DOS program, so it is possible that you might not care.)

2020-03-16 01:32:39 <int-e> Hooloovo0: nah it was properly released... not just exploiting the fact that nobody's coming after you for your copyright violation
2020-03-16 01:32:57 <Hooloovo0> oh, that's cool
2020-03-16 01:37:31 <int-e> hrm. CTRL-F9     Kill dosbox.
2020-03-16 01:37:42 <int-e> whose bright idea was that ;)
2020-03-16 01:38:19 <zzo38> You could disable it if you do not want that, I suppose.
2020-03-16 01:38:51 <int-e> (CTRL-F9 runs programs in the Borland Pascal IDE)
2020-03-16 01:39:53 <zzo38> I wanted to make it to use the "context menu" key instead of CTRL for this purpose, although if you save that into the configuration file, then it won't work. Does the new version fix this?

2020-03-16 01:57:25 <kmc> ah
2020-03-16 01:57:37 <kmc> but every modern CPU can run a plain emulator like dosbox faster than any original DOS machine, right?
2020-03-16 01:57:56 <int-e> Yes.
2020-03-16 02:00:20 <int-e> The BP IDE doesn't even run in the dosemu... some dpmi problem. Works in dosbox though.
2020-03-16 02:01:36 <kmc> huh
2020-03-16 02:03:12 <int-e> http://int-e.eu/~bf3/tmp/bpc.png <-- looks weird
2020-03-16 02:05:00 <int-e> But who knows. I may have misconfigured something, and I cannot really be bothered to debug this.
2020-03-16 02:06:32 <int-e> Especially given the alternative that works.
2020-03-16 02:29:32 <zzo38> Someone said they were considering updating NNTP for 2020, and posted a proposal to the IETF. I suggested increasing article numbers from 31-bits to 63-bits, and adding the WHOAMI command, both of these features I have implemented in my own software. Maybe the IETF will make this official.

2020-03-16 02:32:24 <ais523> hearing that Turbo Pascal is now available in perpetual free-trial form is pretty encouraging
2020-03-16 02:32:29 <ais523> I still have some old Pascal code from a while back
2020-03-16 02:32:46 <ais523> I remember translating it into C but the C ran more slowly; that surprised me at the time and still surprises me now
2020-03-16 02:32:54 <ais523> maybe the Pascal had a better optimiser, or faster supporting libraries, or something
2020-03-16 02:34:59 <ais523> oh wow, this pascal source is so old that the file ends with a literal ^Z character
2020-03-16 02:35:06 <ais523> how long ago was it that text files stopped needing those?
2020-03-16 02:35:55 <int-e> I'm not sure, was it when we abandoned CP/M?
2020-03-16 02:35:56 <zzo38> Maybe Pascal is faster because it is DOS.
2020-03-16 02:36:05 <ais523> the C compiler was also DOS
2020-03-16 02:36:09 <ais523> I think, at least
2020-03-16 02:39:07 <ais523> oh wow, the executable I compiled from the Pascal source still runs (in DOSBox)
2020-03-16 02:39:08 <zzo38> Yes, although Pascal may be more suitable for DOS, at least in real mode.
2020-03-16 02:39:13 <ais523> I guess that's not a surprise
2020-03-16 02:39:35 <ais523> the executable I compiled from the C source does not run ‚Äì it's missing dependencies ‚Äì and I guess the problem is that those dependencies appear to be manually linked
2020-03-16 02:39:44 <ais523> which could be very slow given that the pixels are written individually with function calls
2020-03-16 02:40:02 <zzo38> What graphics mode?
2020-03-16 02:40:43 <ais523> it looks like 16-color 640◊480 VGA
2020-03-16 02:41:02 <int-e> CP/M was a good guess, it seems; I vaguely remembered the record-based file access (which DOS mimics in its FCB interface for backward compatibility). "The CP/M file system only recorded the lengths of files in multiples of 128-byte "records", so by convention a Control-Z character was used to mark the end of meaningful data if it ended in the middle of a record."...
2020-03-16 02:41:07 <int-e> ...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-file
2020-03-16 02:42:27 <zzo38> Yes, although I don't know why it should be ^Z, since that isn't the ASCII code for end of file; ^D might make more sense
2020-03-16 02:42:45 <int-e> But Z is the last letter of the alphabet.
2020-03-16 02:43:04 <int-e> . o O ( It's the latin omega. )
2020-03-16 02:44:09 <zzo38> Yes, although it stands for "substitute" and not "end of file", isn't it?
2020-03-16 02:45:08 <int-e> Whatever that means.
2020-03-16 02:46:44 <ais523> the intended use was as an equivalent of REPLACEMENT CHARACTER
2020-03-16 02:46:47 <zzo38> I think "substitute" means there is no valid character, so it substitutes ^Z in its place.
2020-03-16 02:46:50 <ais523> `unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER
2020-03-16 02:46:52 <HackEso> ‚ÄãÔøΩ
2020-03-16 02:47:20 <ais523> but it was mostly used for other purposes, and Unicode had to add a separate such character at U+FFFD
2020-03-16 02:47:52 <int-e> Well, I remember that ^A and ^B displayed smileys. That's not in line with ASCII either. I don't think CP/M and DOS developers cared all that much.
2020-03-16 02:48:16 <ais523> int-e: code page 437 assigns glyphs for characters in the C0 and C1 regions, in addition to G0 and G1
2020-03-16 02:48:22 <int-e> (Or the PC BIOS developers which may be the actual people responsible?)
2020-03-16 02:48:24 <zzo38> Yes, in the PC character set, the graphics at those points corrsepond to faces.
2020-03-16 02:48:27 <ais523> the C0 characters are very hard to write on most output devices
2020-03-16 02:48:48 <ais523> the C1 characters are incompatible with most of the relevant standards, but are used often enough that terminals often need to find a way to output them anyway
2020-03-16 02:49:25 <zzo38> That is true of all of the control range; there are also graphics there on a PC, so that if you write directly to the video memory, they will be visible.
2020-03-16 02:50:08 <int-e> Whatever. CP/M and by extention DOS used ^Z to mark the end of files. That's really where the discussion should've ended.
2020-03-16 02:50:33 <ais523> policing topicality here can be kind-of hard :-D
2020-03-16 02:50:35 <int-e> Unless you have a time machine.
2020-03-16 02:50:36 <zzo38> Yes, that is probably why DOS does that, because of CP/M.
2020-03-16 02:50:45 <ais523> and retrocomputing is closer to our main topic than much of what's discussed here
2020-03-16 02:51:08 <int-e> ais523: I'm mostly annoyed at myself for participating in it beyond that point :)
2020-03-16 02:51:09 <ais523> I've actually put thought into writing an esolang for retrocomputing purposes
2020-03-16 02:51:32 <ais523> the main aim being to reduce the amount of RAM that a program written in it takes to run, as far as possible
2020-03-16 02:51:35 <zzo38> Yes, and even in esolang wiki there is a few retrocomputing stuff. And, I do want to see your esolang for retrocomputing purposes once you write it.
2020-03-16 02:52:03 <ais523> using any trick available; overlays, swapping to disk, using bytecode interpreters with compressed bytecode, etc.
2020-03-16 02:52:27 <ais523> I didn't design most of the details
2020-03-16 02:52:46 <ais523> one idea I had was for it to be a byte-compiled language where the bytecode used return-oriented programming
2020-03-16 02:52:58 <ais523> as a method of compression in addition to a method of function calls
2020-03-16 02:54:51 <ais523> another idea I had was to store all values as 1 byte on the stack, if they were more than 1 byte wide then a hash table element would be tied to the stack location and contain the real value, with the stack containing information to find the element
2020-03-16 02:55:09 <ais523> you could probably do something similar with the heap
2020-03-16 02:56:15 <ais523> but these are just ideas, and that's all I have, it's not like there's some big plan that I'm hiding
2020-03-16 02:56:33 <zzo38> OK
2020-03-16 02:57:15 <zzo38> I like those ideas
2020-03-16 02:58:41 <zzo38> (I thought of the similar idea about return-oriented programming before, too)
2020-03-16 02:59:24 <ais523> I'm actually surprised that return-oriented programming isn't done more often as a programming technique in cases where you don't have to use it
2020-03-16 02:59:36 <ais523> (of course, for the exploits against W^X code, it's often necessary)
2020-03-16 02:59:57 <ais523> I guess Underload has some similarities to return-oriented programming
2020-03-16 03:00:05 <ais523> although there are a lot of differences too
2020-03-16 03:02:45 <int-e> ais523: I imagine it's rather expensive because it messes up the builtin call-stack based branch prediction.
2020-03-16 03:03:03 <ais523> int-e: that's not necessarily the case if using a bytecode interpreter
2020-03-16 03:03:10 <int-e> (of modern CPUs)
2020-03-16 03:03:23 <ais523> but yes, it seems likely you'd have a lot of mispredicted branches
2020-03-16 03:03:29 <ais523> that doesn't matter so much in retrocomputing, though
2020-03-16 03:04:37 <int-e> I've certainly played funny tricks with the stack in golfing assembly code
2020-03-16 03:05:19 <int-e> (well, machine code is what was golfed, really, but I wrote it in assembly) really, but I
2020-03-16 03:06:24 <int-e> ... ^J (line feed = return key) is next to ^K (delete until end of line)
2020-03-16 03:06:43 <int-e> I've had so many IRC editing accidents because of this.
2020-03-16 03:06:44 <ais523> well, you normally don't linefeed mid-line anyway
2020-03-16 03:07:10 <ais523> oh, I see, you're trying to delete to the end of the line, but press ^J by mistake
2020-03-16 03:07:17 <int-e> Yes.
2020-03-16 03:07:20 <ais523> my most common accident of that nature is hitting Return instead of Backspace
2020-03-16 03:07:43 <ais523> (which are, again, adjacent, and you need to reach a long way to hit backspace, over Return)
2020-03-16 03:07:48 <int-e> Hmm. Wrong keyboard layout for this, \ is between backspace and return here.
2020-03-16 03:07:56 <ais523> I guess you could reach for the left-hand side of Backspace
2020-03-16 03:08:02 <int-e> This often happens involuntarily though:\
2020-03-16 03:08:13 <ais523> no, I mean I could
2020-03-16 03:08:15 <ais523> to avoid the issue
2020-03-16 03:08:36 <ais523> but spoke ambiguously because basically nobody uses "one" as a pronoun nowadays and none of the common replacements are really satisfactory
2020-03-16 03:09:38 <int-e> ais523: the "you" didn't affect what I typed at all :)
2020-03-16 03:10:18 <int-e> I was just trying to relate to the problem and realized that I no longer have this particular one.
2020-03-16 03:11:02 <ais523> ais523- was using a laptop that was dropped ~3 years ago as an emergency replacement
2020-03-16 03:11:16 <ais523> the keyboard layout was very similar to my current layout except that home/end were swapped with pgup/pgdn
2020-03-16 03:11:28 <int-e> yuck
2020-03-16 03:11:36 <int-e> why do people get creative on that front...
2020-03-16 03:11:57 <ais523> (also it was using a bootable USB stick as the OS because I didn't want to substantially change the existing filesystem (for archival purposes), and its existing OS hadn't been updated in 3 years)
2020-03-16 03:12:14 <ais523> I felt that merited half an underscore
2020-03-16 03:12:34 <int-e> Is this a weak form of vendor lockin?
2020-03-16 03:12:46 <ais523> it could be, I guess
2020-03-16 03:12:53 <int-e> You /could/ use any laptop but half of them will confuse you with their keyboard layout?
2020-03-16 03:12:58 <ais523> I actually abandoned the old vendor (HP) because I didn't like its UEFI implementation
2020-03-16 03:13:28 <ais523> hmm, should the pronoun be "their" rather than "its"? I never did decide whether a company is singular or plural
2020-03-16 03:14:37 <ais523> the biggest offences of the implementation appeared to be a) making the secure boot variables read-only whenever they were edited once, until you did a full reset of the secure boot state
2020-03-16 03:14:44 <int-e> I'd probably go for "their". But I also use singular "their" for gender-neutral means.
2020-03-16 03:15:04 <ais523> b) resetting the default bootloader to Windows's bootloader whenever you went into the UEFI settings
2020-03-16 03:15:08 <int-e> Though in this case I imagine a company as a group of people.
2020-03-16 03:15:28 <ais523> I think it's fairly well established that companies don't have genders and don't use pronouns that are intended only for people
2020-03-16 03:15:48 <ais523> so gender-neutrality isn't really an issue in this context, just singular/plural
2020-03-16 03:16:00 <int-e> Oh yeah I remember having to jump through some hoops to boot Linux on my former work HP Elite notebook.
2020-03-16 03:16:07 <ais523> I guess an Agoran "eir" wouldn't be that out of place, corporations act like people in some respects after all, and "eir" is appropriate for non-human people
2020-03-16 03:16:39 <ais523> I think it's interesting that most Linux distributions don't add themselves to Windows' bootloader, it would seem like a logical thing to do
2020-03-16 03:17:01 <ais523> (so that you could use either shim+GRUB, or Windows Boot Manager, based on personal preference; and yet boot into all your OSes either way)
2020-03-16 03:18:36 <zzo38> If you use both Linux and Windows, then yes it can make sense I think
2020-03-16 03:19:20 <ais523> I think it's interesting that the common Linux implementation has bootloaders stacked 3 deep
2020-03-16 03:19:44 <int-e> speaking of booting... why do I have 17 linux kernel images installed :/
2020-03-16 03:19:52 <ais523> (firmware UEFI ‚Üí shim ‚Üí grub), and if you have a multiboot setup this stacks bootloaders 4 deep (because grub chain-loads Windows Boot Manager)
2020-03-16 03:20:12 <ais523> not all these levels are actually needed
2020-03-16 03:21:03 <int-e> And why doesn't debian remove them all and then rebuild the initrds once.
2020-03-16 03:21:24 <zzo38> I think UEFI isn't very good
2020-03-16 03:21:31 <ais523> shim is a complicated compromise
2020-03-16 03:21:34 <int-e> zzo38: whatever
2020-03-16 03:22:23 <ais523> basically, it's a consequence of UEFI mandating an executable format that a) can only contain one digital signature and b) shipping with only Microsoft's key by default
2020-03-16 03:22:34 <ais523> b) isn't part of the standard, it's just what happens in practice
2020-03-16 03:23:04 <ais523> so it exists purely to validate a bootloader against someone else's key and then chain-load it
2020-03-16 03:23:36 <ais523> the various Linux distros persuade Microsoft to sign versions of shim that recognise their key, which is easier than trying to persuade every motherboard manufacturer to recognise their key
2020-03-16 03:24:25 <int-e> Hmm, with grubx64.efi isn't it just UEFI -> grub?
2020-03-16 03:24:36 <ais523> int-e: whose signature does grub have?
2020-03-16 03:25:06 <ais523> in my experience, distros put a signed version of grub into the UEFI bootloaders directory, but the UEFI refuses to load it unless someone manually changes the list of approved keys
2020-03-16 03:25:08 <int-e> Oh. You want actual secure boot?
2020-03-16 03:25:16 <ais523> why not?
2020-03-16 03:25:24 <int-e> It's fine.
2020-03-16 03:25:42 <int-e> And it explains the role of shim, I suppose.
2020-03-16 03:26:00 <ais523> one of the many ideas I've had and will never have time to act on, is a UEFI program that lets the user manage keys manually, choosing who to trust and who not to trust
2020-03-16 03:26:14 <ais523> together with kernels that check the filesystem for integrity during boot (at least, the parts they execute)
2020-03-16 03:26:50 <ais523> you wouldn't need much more than a signed md5sums file and a more secure hashing algorithm than md5
2020-03-16 03:28:52 <ais523> I guess an extreme version would require some sort of password to set files as +x‚Ä¶

2020-03-16 04:30:55 <ais523> hi shinh
2020-03-16 05:04:10 <ais523> question to everyone: I invented an esolang just to write one program, and have now written the program, but haven't implemented the esolang
2020-03-16 05:04:18 <ais523> should I implement the esolang, or just compile the program by hand?
2020-03-16 05:10:31 <zzo38> What program and what esolang?
2020-03-16 05:21:41 <ais523> I'm talking in general terms here
2020-03-16 05:21:53 <ais523> I'll be putting it up on the wiki once I'm sure it works
2020-03-16 05:23:22 <ais523> actually, screw it, I'll upload the program
2020-03-16 05:23:58 <ais523> here's the program: http://nethack4.org/pastebin/spiral-rise.wck
2020-03-16 05:24:22 <ais523> it's an esolang interpreter (for a new esolang called Spiral Rise) written in another new esolang (called Waterfall Construction Kit)
2020-03-16 05:24:28 <ais523> WCK is meant to compile to The Waterfall Model
2020-03-16 05:24:57 <ais523> and is currently defined by that one example program, which is its purpose for existence
2020-03-16 05:26:22 <ais523> I think the program is correct, although I'm not sure, it's pretty hard to test
2020-03-16 05:26:36 <ais523> I think I'm going to try compiling it by hand
2020-03-16 05:26:55 <zzo38> O, OK. I think that it is worth at least documenting WCK properly.
2020-03-16 05:49:02 <ais523> what's 310031-in-base-5 in decimal?
2020-03-16 05:50:46 <zzo38> If you mean 310031 is a base five number, then the decimal is 10016. (You can figure out this by dc easily. It can also be figured out easily in JavaScript and also in PostScript.)
2020-03-16 05:51:17 <ais523> I thought dc might be able to do it, but I wasn't sure how
2020-03-16 05:51:33 <ais523> thanks for the answer, anyway, you interpreted the question correctly
2020-03-16 05:51:56 <zzo38> How to do in dc is: 5i310031p

2020-03-16 07:40:21 <b_jonas> ais523: DOS editors added the ^Z, not because they needed it, but for backwards compatibility with DOS 1. it's like how all windows programs and editors write crlf line endings by default, despite that most windows programs read lf just fine.
2020-03-16 07:42:09 <b_jonas> int-e: CP/M and DOS version 1, because DOS version 1 has CP/M's record-based file access. DOS 2 fixes this, adding unix-style open/close/read/write calls (NB. DOS 1 doesn't even have a close), and file descriptors that can point to things other than disk files, so you can redirect the stdout of programs. DOS 3 adds some more calls.
2020-03-16 07:45:37 <b_jonas> ais523: like storing function return address a single byte on the stack, provided that there are no more than 256 call sites to the function after inlining?
2020-03-16 07:47:37 <ais523> b_jonas: I think that might be incompatible with return-oriented programming
2020-03-16 07:47:51 <ais523> because it requires you to track what functions are currently running
2020-03-16 07:54:01 <kmc> what is record-based file access?
2020-03-16 07:56:26 <Hooloovo0> I'm pretty sure that return-oriented programming is usually unintended behavior
2020-03-16 07:57:34 <Hooloovo0> (usually)
2020-03-16 07:58:03 <b_jonas> btw, do we want a Planet of the Hats comic strip list, in the sense of `*list ?
2020-03-16 07:58:33 <Hooloovo0> it also seems like that would only be useful on old CPUs... it would be hell on branch predictors
2020-03-16 08:01:23 <b_jonas> int-e: "why do I have 17 linux kernel images installed" => I don't delete the old ones either until the space on the one gigabyte sized boot gets low
2020-03-16 08:02:58 <b_jonas> kmc: in CP/M and DOS 1, can't just ask the kernel to read or write any number of bytes, instead you can only read a fixed size block, which corresponds to a block stored contiguously on the disk. as a consequence for this, the file size isn't stored in byte granularity either.
2020-03-16 08:04:49 <b_jonas> this was the old default until unix came along, and it would still make sense for regular files, though with a variable block size that the kernel decides for you, because why the heck would you need a buffer for regular files both in the kernel and in userspace?
2020-03-16 08:04:52 <kmc> what's the block size, and is it the same for every file?
2020-03-16 08:04:59 <kmc> mm
2020-03-16 08:05:04 <b_jonas> kmc: on CP/M and DOS 1, they are the same
2020-03-16 08:05:23 <b_jonas> these days, it's only the same on one file system, might vary after that
2020-03-16 08:05:26 <kmc> so†^Z is used to indicate the actual end of the file within the block?
2020-03-16 08:05:37 <b_jonas> back then it was the same globally, because there was only one type of file system
2020-03-16 08:05:41 <kmc> right
2020-03-16 08:05:42 <b_jonas> kmc: for text files, yes
2020-03-16 08:05:52 <b_jonas> other files like executables can have any format the programs handle
2020-03-16 08:06:09 <Hooloovo0> it makes a lot of sense for floppy drives - the only writable sections are blocks
2020-03-16 08:06:16 <kmc> also, why ^Z
2020-03-16 08:06:26 <Hooloovo0> and in the early days of DOS and CP/M, that's all you really had
2020-03-16 08:06:29 <kmc> doesn't ASCII have a C0 control code for end of file? is it ^Z?
2020-03-16 08:07:02 <b_jonas> kmc: that was discussed earlier in chat, we don't know why ^Z but it would be stupid to change it now
2020-03-16 08:07:11 <kmc> it's kind of tragic how the C0 control codes, most of which are never used, occupy prime 1-byte real estate in UTF-8
2020-03-16 08:07:14 <kmc> c'est la vie

2020-03-16 08:08:19 <Hooloovo0> anything >0x7f is undefined in ascii, right?
2020-03-16 08:08:33 <b_jonas> Hooloovo0: that hasn't changed, even these days hard disks and SSDs are written in blocks. in fact, with hard disks having controllers built onto them, you can't even do anything about it, whereas back in the old days you had some control over the format of your floppies.
2020-03-16 08:08:52 <zzo38> The ASCII control code for end of file isn't ^Z; that is due to CP/M, not ASCII.
2020-03-16 08:09:03 <b_jonas> Hooloovo0: although file systems add an abstraction layer over that, where a logical block for storing files can be larger than the physical sectors
2020-03-16 08:09:15 <kmc> (and the even more obscure C1 codes occupy 1-byte real estate in ISO 8859, but the 8-bit Windows code pages put printing characters there instead)
2020-03-16 08:09:32 <Hooloovo0> yeah, I know that, but given the age and early status of the OSs, an there were no real alternatives to floppies...
2020-03-16 08:09:36 <kmc> Hooloovo0: correct. ASCII is a 7-bit code
2020-03-16 08:10:00 <b_jonas> Hooloovo0: sure there were, they were casettes, only those are much less reliable than floppy disks
2020-03-16 08:10:13 <Hooloovo0> then how can you have C0/C1 codes? that's 8 bits
2020-03-16 08:10:26 <Hooloovo0> technically, sure
2020-03-16 08:10:28 <kmc> C0 and C1 are not meant to be hex numbers here
2020-03-16 08:10:32 <Hooloovo0> ohhhh
2020-03-16 08:10:32 <kmc> they're just called that for some reason
2020-03-16 08:10:33 <b_jonas> and ROM cartridges of course, which are _more_ reliable than floppy disks, but you can only write them in huge production runs
2020-03-16 08:10:52 * Hooloovo0 is currently in the middle of a tape backup
2020-03-16 08:11:05 <kmc> C0 codes are 00-1F hex and C1 codes are 80-9F
2020-03-16 08:11:24 <kmc> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes
2020-03-16 08:11:33 <kmc> > ASCII defined 32 control characters, plus a necessary extra one for the all-1 DEL character (needed to punch out all the holes on a paper tape and erase it).

2020-03-16 08:11:43 <kmc> oh! so that's why DEL is 0x7F
2020-03-16 08:11:45 <kmc> lol
2020-03-16 08:11:53 <Hooloovo0> yeah, it's because of paper tape
2020-03-16 08:11:56 <kmc> always wondered why they put it at the end
2020-03-16 08:12:00 <b_jonas> kmc: and poor \x7F would be an orphan out of blocks if it weren't for that it used to be one of the more useful control characters for 7-bit paper tape

2020-03-16 08:17:51 <zzo38> Yes, although it only displayed them because my IRC client filters control codes
2020-03-16 08:18:31 <kmc> I didn't, nor are they in the logs

2020-03-16 08:22:10 <Hooloovo0> I got a good amount of bells
2020-03-16 08:22:27 <Hooloovo0> apparently unicode fucks it up a lot
2020-03-16 08:22:31 <kmc> nice
2020-03-16 08:22:35 * moony may be getting a chance to remote into a VAX tonight, on that note. Moony is happy.
2020-03-16 08:22:36 <kmc> does it have a mechanical bell
2020-03-16 08:23:04 <Hooloovo0> my terminal doesn't
2020-03-16 08:23:15 <Hooloovo0> but I know a couple people with ASR33s...
2020-03-16 08:24:54 <Hooloovo0> hmm, I wonder if I can figure out how to make BEL make asterisk do a single ring...
2020-03-16 08:25:38 <Hooloovo0> there's currently 3 physical bells on my desk, and one not far
2020-03-16 08:27:28 <kmc> rofl
2020-03-16 08:27:30 <kmc> that'd be a fun hack
2020-03-16 08:27:36 <kmc> do you collect old phones or something?
2020-03-16 08:27:53 <Hooloovo0> yeah
2020-03-16 08:28:06 <Hooloovo0> I've got a couple channel banks
2020-03-16 08:28:24 <Hooloovo0> I've been looking for a decent non-asterisk pbx
2020-03-16 08:29:08 <Hooloovo0> I'm more into phone systems, but it's hard to be into that without also collecting phones

2020-03-16 08:34:52 <kmc> cool
2020-03-16 08:35:04 <kmc> I have a rotary phone that i bought at a hamfest
2020-03-16 08:35:11 <kmc> I took it apart and then didn't do anything with it :/
2020-03-16 08:35:13 <kmc> feel kinda bad
2020-03-16 08:35:24 <kmc> i could give the parts to someone who wants them
2020-03-16 08:35:38 <kmc> there was supposed to be another hamfest on Saturday, but it got cancelled :/
2020-03-16 08:35:47 <moony> I took apart a working IBM PC keyboard when I was (much) younger. Still regret it, perfectly good keyboard ):
2020-03-16 08:35:49 <kmc> as did the big Hamvention in Ohio in may
2020-03-16 08:36:03 <kmc> i feel taking things apart is virtuous, though
2020-03-16 08:36:07 <kmc> in general
2020-03-16 08:36:14 <Hooloovo0> yeah, taking things apart is good
2020-03-16 08:36:21 <kmc> especially if you learn something
2020-03-16 08:36:39 <Hooloovo0> if a piece of electronics gets taken apart, it died a good death
2020-03-16 08:36:39 <Hooloovo0> yeah
2020-03-16 08:36:46 <moony> All I learned was that the keyboard controller was a Zilog made one
2020-03-16 08:36:54 <moony> apparently
2020-03-16 08:37:13 <moony> (Was probably a clone's keyboard? I forget, parts are long gone)
2020-03-16 08:37:30 <Hooloovo0> I've got a couple rotary dials sitting around in a box
2020-03-16 08:37:39 <Hooloovo0> came from the junk store
2020-03-16 08:37:52 <Hooloovo0> I kind of wish they just sold the phones...
2020-03-16 08:42:32 <zzo38> I might suggest to make a telephone out of those parts, then.

2020-03-16 10:11:24 <b_jonas> "<Hooloovo0> there's currently 3 physical bells on my desk, and one not far" => there are three in my drawer, but they're not electric, they're tiny decorational cowbell style bells that you can only ring by hand. plus there's a wind bell hung next to me at the bookshelf, also ringable by hand only.
2020-03-16 10:12:09 <Hooloovo0> the three on my desk are all in telephones, as is the other
2020-03-16 10:12:34 <Hooloovo0> I can also ring the one in the kitchen
2020-03-16 10:13:13 * Hooloovo0 only has one desk drawer, and it's filled with calculators
2020-03-16 10:13:25 <b_jonas> oh yeah, I have an electronic doorbell, an electronic bell in my home phone, and an electronic bell in the door phone
2020-03-16 10:13:29 <Hooloovo0> like, I have too many calculators that thy don't all fit
2020-03-16 10:13:30 <ais523> b_jonas: it depends on who owns the vax; if you don't have admin rights there and are using telnet or something, then 2-3; if you can install your own IRC clients on it, probably only 1-1Ω
2020-03-16 10:14:01 <Hooloovo0> yeah, I installed my own IRC client
2020-03-16 10:14:10 <Hooloovo0> the drive as I got it was useless
2020-03-16 10:14:21 <Hooloovo0> but the drive worked!
2020-03-16 10:14:41 <Hooloovo0> (had useless stuff on it, not broken)
2020-03-16 10:15:16 <Hooloovo0> installing 4.3bsd isn't too trivial when you don't have a tape drive
2020-03-16 10:18:59 <ais523> b_jonas: the best way to think of it is that it's a scale based on how much you hate your setup, which means that an underscore-laden setup only happens if you have no real ability to change it (otherwise, you would have changed it rather than using a setup you hate)

2020-03-16 10:24:43 <ais523> incidentally, something I noticed recently: a program in The Waterfall Model with n non-halt waterclocks can be compiled into a FRACTRAN program with N+1 fractions
2020-03-16 10:25:48 <ais523> the basic idea is to use a prime for each waterclock (including halting waterclocks), then multiply together all the primes but one in order to implement a zeroing trigger
2020-03-16 10:26:36 <ais523> then if none of those fractions can run, a final fraction does the steady decrement
2020-03-16 10:27:01 <ais523> halting waterclocks aren't given fractions, but are still given primes, so if one of them zeroes, none of the fractions can run because their prime is multiplied into every denominator
2020-03-16 10:27:48 <ais523> hmm, I should post that on the Waterfall talk page

2020-03-16 11:02:47 <ais523> wib_jonas: does searching for "ClearType" in the various control panels help?
2020-03-16 11:03:08 <ais523> it can take a while to find all the settings programs the one you can get at by right-clicking the start menu is fairly comprehensive though
2020-03-16 11:03:54 <wib_jonas> ais523: ah yes, now it worked. I typed it to the control panel search first, and it didn't find anything. now I typed it to the Settings, and it did find the option, and opened a control panel app. wtf.
2020-03-16 11:06:23 <wib_jonas> and yes, searching apps in the start menu for "ClearType" finds it too, that's where I should have started
2020-03-16 11:06:49 <ais523> I wonder if "antialiasing" also works, or whether you have to use the marketing name
2020-03-16 11:08:06 <wib_jonas> "antialiasing" doesn't, but there are probably other keywords that find it

2020-03-16 11:18:06 <wib_jonas> The coronavirus liability cascade has reached our boss, so he told us to work from home. This just two workdays after we could have started to work more efficiently in the office, because all the interns who normally come in only a few days a week can now work full-time since universities are closed, and this office happens to have few parents who
2020-03-16 11:18:07 <wib_jonas> have to stay home because schools are closed.
2020-03-16 11:18:48 <wib_jonas> So I'm setting up the work notebook for use at home. The monitor and lighting conditions are better there, but I have to change the ClearType settings, and possibly also the gamma setting.
2020-03-16 11:19:45 <wib_jonas> I'm glad I brought the work mouse home. It's worse than my home mouse, but my home mouse is for PS/2 port, and the notebook doesn't have a PS/2 port.
2020-03-16 11:20:08 <wib_jonas> Though I'll have to check which direction passive converters work, I think I have two in my drawer
2020-03-16 11:20:52 <wib_jonas> Yeah, I remembered right, the passive converters let newer USB mouse to plug into PS/2 ports. That doesn't help me.
2020-03-16 11:21:04 <wib_jonas> Oh well.
2020-03-16 11:22:36 <wib_jonas> Anyway, this results in the unprecedented state that I'm not only connected as b_jonas and wib_jonas at the same time, but also they are NATed to the same public IP address.

2020-03-16 13:33:14 <fizzie> Subpixel reindeering is what Santa uses to get around the world so fast. Not sure how.
2020-03-16 13:34:51 <fizzie> Also working from home, incidentally. Kind of interesting, after having just swapped the Linux laptop to a ChromeOS tablet (rationale: "I only ever use this for browsing on work travel, anyway, not for real work"), which has a total of two USB-C ports, and that's it for holes in it.
2020-03-16 13:39:17 <wib_jonas> this one doesn't have a DVI port either, but I had the sense to bring the HDMI cable from work
2020-03-16 13:39:58 <wib_jonas> also, these fans need to be tuned, my home computer and the work computer are giving noise in disharmony.
2020-03-16 13:40:15 <wib_jonas> (mostly I should just replace my home computer with a not so loud computer)
2020-03-16 13:46:48 <fizzie> I did buy one of those USB-C dongle things (2x USB-A 3.0, 1x USB-A 2.0, HDMI, Ethernet, SD/micro-SD, DC pass-through from a USB-C charger) "on the off chance I'll need to hook up the monitor and keyboard, though that's not very likely, I don't usually work from home", which turned out to be a good idea.
2020-03-16 13:47:42 <wib_jonas> this notebook has a docking station, but it still has very few ports
2020-03-16 13:47:53 <wib_jonas> no DVI in particular
2020-03-16 13:48:26 <wib_jonas> nor a microphone port
2020-03-16 13:49:57 <wib_jonas> it's mostly useless
2020-03-16 14:00:01 <wib_jonas> `olist 1195

2020-03-16 14:00:52 User Name: Sgeo = Sgeo__!~Sgeo@ool-18b982ad.dyn.optonline.net
2020-03-16 14:00:52 <Sgeo> BTW all OOTS books are on 50% discount until later today wih coupon "washyourhands"
2020-03-16 14:01:15 <wib_jonas> Sgeo__: does that discount the shipping too?
2020-03-16 14:01:21 <wib_jonas> because the shipping is the expensive part
2020-03-16 14:01:42 <Sgeo> Oh, just the e-book versions
2020-03-16 14:01:56 <wib_jonas> ah
2020-03-16 14:02:06 <wib_jonas> well that can be helpful, let me check
2020-03-16 14:04:49 <wib_jonas> Sgeo__: that would actually gives an almost acceptible price for the e-books. I'll have to consider this quickly.
2020-03-16 14:17:24 User Name: arseniiv = arseniiv!~arseniiv@94.41.9.97.dynamic.ufanet.ru
2020-03-16 14:17:24 <arseniiv> <wib_jonas> also, these fans need to be tuned, my home computer and the work computer are giving noise in disharmony. => do you have a microwave? It could alleviate the situation. Or maybe a vacuum. Or maybe both, this could end up as a neat seventh chord
2020-03-16 14:18:46 <wib_jonas> arseniiv: I have a microwave in the kitchen, yes, and I have a vacuum cleaner too
2020-03-16 14:18:54 <wib_jonas> also a washing machine and a dishwasher
2020-03-16 14:19:04 <arseniiv> now bring them all in one room, yes, and a machine too
2020-03-16 14:19:08 <wib_jonas> and a gas oven
2020-03-16 14:19:13 <arseniiv> hm I don‚Äôt know how dishwashers sound
2020-03-16 14:19:42 <arseniiv> presumably a gas oven would be almost silent
2020-03-16 14:19:52 <wib_jonas> that would be hard, because the oven absolutely can't be moved, and the dishwasher and the washing machine at least need to be connected to water and drain pipes while under operation
2020-03-16 14:20:42 <arseniiv> hmhmhmhm then you need to place a couple microphones in there and‚Ä¶ hm too time-costly
2020-03-16 14:20:44 <wib_jonas> so I'd have to move the washing machine into the kitchen, which would need extra plumbing parts, and I'd really rather not do the installation myself
2020-03-16 14:20:58 <wib_jonas> taking the computers there wouldn't be too difficult at least
2020-03-16 14:21:17 <arseniiv> yeah at least you could take a vacuum with you
2020-03-16 14:21:24 <wib_jonas> I don't need microphones, I can just open the doors
2020-03-16 14:21:28 <wib_jonas> this house isn't *that* big
2020-03-16 14:22:20 <wib_jonas> also the kitchen doesn't have a floor drain, and the floor is wooden, so running a washing machine there would be impractical
2020-03-16 14:23:03 <arseniiv> agree
2020-03-16 14:23:39 <wib_jonas> on the other hand, these computers can make a variety of noises other than the fan
2020-03-16 14:24:05 <wib_jonas> there are speakers, three sets of them (one that I normally use for the computer, one built into the monitor, and one built into the work laptop), plus hard disks
2020-03-16 14:24:36 <wib_jonas> and even a chasis fan in the home computer, which I've disabled long ago, but I can reenable it easily
2020-03-16 14:24:46 <arseniiv> alas a hard disk is hard to reason with
2020-03-16 14:45:24 <Sgeo> On the Origins of PCs is free with the coupon I believe
2020-03-16 14:46:53 <wib_jonas> Sgeo__: I already have Origins and Darkness and Good Deeds. I'd probably buy book 4 and 3 next.
2020-03-16 14:47:03 <wib_jonas> It's sad that book 6 still isn't listed in https://www.giantitp.com/Shop.html
2020-03-16 14:47:16 <wib_jonas> so you have to find a link to it from the news archive or the forum if you want to buy it
2020-03-16 14:48:55 <wib_jonas> or find it linked on Gumroad from the other books
2020-03-16 14:50:15 <wib_jonas> but half price for book 4 is still 2600 forints for a book that contains mostly the same strips as the web, so I'll skip for now
2020-03-16 15:45:22 <int-e> b_jonas: Well, I don't like that the kernels accumulate like that, especially because removing them with aptitude takes quadratic time. There must be a workaround for that.
2020-03-16 15:49:53 <int-e> b_jonas: e.g. http://paste.debian.net/1135151/
2020-03-16 15:51:49 <wib_jonas> int-e: they don't seem to accumulate just from debian for me, at least not to the amount you mention. debian only keeps one from each abi compat version, which is a level below the kernel version number but above the actual debian package version number, and supposedly increments only when the abi becomes incompatible between kernel and modules
2020-03-16 15:52:32 <int-e> wib_jonas: I'm un debian unstable, which has many more kernels (and a good reason to keep *some* around. I just wish it wasn't every single one, ever)
2020-03-16 15:52:41 <wib_jonas> whereas they often do kernel updates within an abi version, and I usually copy those kernels to my boot partition now (but only because of this weird setup; and I don't copy the modules)
2020-03-16 15:52:47 <int-e> I'm *running
2020-03-16 15:52:48 <wib_jonas> oh, debian unstable. that's different
2020-03-16 15:52:59 <wib_jonas> I don't run unstable, and wouldn't run it
2020-03-16 15:53:37 <wib_jonas> it takes quadratic time to remove them? ouch
2020-03-16 15:54:11 <wib_jonas> it's no surprise that debian unstable has more kernel versions
2020-03-16 15:58:24 <int-e> The obvious improvement here would be to not regenerate the initrd after every single purge. Not sure how to achieve that.
2020-03-16 15:59:49 <wib_jonas> how does that even become quadratic?
2020-03-16 16:00:21 <wib_jonas> I mean, maybe it regenerates the initrd with the current latest kernel version's modules every purge, but that's just linear,
2020-03-16 16:00:39 <wib_jonas> plus it could regenerate the boot loader config file after every purge, which is technically quadratic but with a very small constant factor
2020-03-16 16:01:46 <int-e> wib_jonas: because for some inexplicable reason, locating each of these images takes non-negligible time.
2020-03-16 16:02:04 <int-e> so the initrd generation becomes noticably slower with more kernel images
2020-03-16 16:02:43 <wib_jonas> also, out of curiosity, are you running debian unstable as a hobby for home, or for some job in sysadmin or similar capacity?
2020-03-16 16:03:24 <int-e> This is at home. I wouldn't do it for servers. I would probably do it for my own software development needs if allowed.
2020-03-16 16:03:54 <wib_jonas> not on live servers, sure, but are you doing it to be able to prepare for future system problems at work?
2020-03-16 16:04:01 <int-e> It's a matter of laziness really... debian unstable is much better at having the latest versions of compilers and the like.
2020-03-16 16:04:07 <wib_jonas> I'm asking more "for home" rather than "at home",
2020-03-16 16:04:21 <wib_jonas> I see
2020-03-16 16:04:43 <int-e> And it is surprisingly stable, given the name.
2020-03-16 16:05:28 <int-e> Make no mistake, I've seen it break badly... happens once, maybe twice a year, and *most* of the time it's easy to fix.
2020-03-16 16:06:05 <wib_jonas> sure, but I prefer that to happen not at unpredictable times, but at the times when I decide to upgrade to the latest stable version and spend days setting it up and debugging problems
2020-03-16 16:06:17 <int-e> The last such annoyance was firefox relying on sqllite interna.
2020-03-16 16:06:36 <int-e> I don't do automatic updates anyway.
2020-03-16 16:06:42 <wib_jonas> and for the software where I particularly care about having the latest version, which could be compilers, or gimp 2.10, or whatever, they're usually easy to install
2020-03-16 16:06:51 <wib_jonas> at least if you're not running a too old stable version
2020-03-16 16:07:30 <int-e> Anyway, obviously this is not any kind of advice. For me, Debian unstable hits the sweet spot between stability and bleeding edge better than debian stable.
2020-03-16 16:08:01 <int-e> And that may change.
2020-03-16 16:08:20 <wib_jonas> sure, I don't do automatic updates either, I just put the security updates on occasionally, but those rarely break anything but firefox (which is its own sort of problem, debian basically doesn't have the resources to follow its changes), whereas for unstable you can't install just the security updates every month
2020-03-16 16:08:30 <wib_jonas> sure, it can change
2020-03-16 16:09:46 <wib_jonas> (I mean the above for my home machine; the work windows machine does run automatic updates)
2020-03-16 16:10:00 <int-e> Also... I ran Gentoo for several years. So compared to that, Debian unstable is MUCH more convenient.
2020-03-16 16:10:28 <int-e> (I can't justify Gentoo anymore except as a learning experience into how software is built and how many things can go wrong in the process.)
2020-03-16 16:10:38 <wib_jonas> meanwhile, IOCCC submissions have ended
2020-03-16 16:10:49 <wib_jonas> sure, I ran Gentoo too, but that was when I was young and had time for that sort of nonsense
2020-03-16 16:10:57 <wib_jonas> and didn't know that I should be running debian

2020-03-16 16:11:02 <int-e> At least I have one or two good stories to tell.
2020-03-16 16:11:44 <int-e> Like the point where I removed libacl because I wasn't using access control lists... and core-utils (uh, what's the old name of that again?) broke.
2020-03-16 16:11:48 <wib_jonas> eventually I managed to break the gentoo system too much, at which point I tried ubuntu for a few weeks, decided it wasn't for me and purged it without a backup, installed debian, and I've been running debian ever since (though multiple different installations of debian)
2020-03-16 16:11:52 <kmc> I ran Gentoo when I got an amd64 machine and Debian still didn't have good support for it
2020-03-16 16:12:00 <kmc> that was in 2004

2020-03-16 17:30:10 <int-e> cpressey: Why FreeBSD and not OpenBSD or NetBSD? ;-) (No, I never had a dog in that fight. I don't even really know what the fight was about... just that there was one.)
2020-03-16 17:30:58 <zzo38> (I use the i3 window manager, with no desktop environment. Programs should not usually be written to require a desktop environment; they should work without it, even if without a desktop environment may require some command-line options to be used which are not otherwise used.)
2020-03-16 17:32:03 <int-e> It is lamentable... the latest development on that front is that certain programs have stopped to respect their working directory.
2020-03-16 17:33:15 <int-e> All of GTK, I think. So if I start inkscape in a subdirectory and try to open a file I'll be in my home directory. Meh.
2020-03-16 17:34:25 <wib_jonas> int-e: I don't care too much about them respecting the wd, but the gtk file dialogs are much worse than the windows ones, into which you can just paste a filename or a file from explorer
2020-03-16 17:34:29 <cpressey> int-e: I actually like NetBSD better, from an aesthetic point of view, but FreeBSD has more users and a more pragmatic outlook, so it's the easier choice.
2020-03-16 17:34:43 <wib_jonas> this is an area where windows manages to "just work" better
2020-03-16 17:36:34 <int-e> I don't know. I like shells. I use working directories as contexts for projects. It's sad to see software add obstacles to that process, just because most users use visual desktop enviroments to manage their files.
2020-03-16 17:37:24 <int-e> But it's not terrible, I complain and cope.
2020-03-16 17:38:20 <int-e> I guess one big reason is that windows is less affected by a proliferation of toolkit libraries.
2020-03-16 17:38:38 <int-e> (though it's mainly Qt and GTK these days.)
2020-03-16 17:40:59 <zzo38> Yes, the Windows file dialog does work better tha GTK, although I would think is OK to just a simple text entry.
2020-03-16 17:42:26 <int-e> @tell oerjan Agatha is such a terrbible mad scientist.
2020-03-16 17:42:26 <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
2020-03-16 17:44:19 <Taneb> int-e: Agatha does also have to be a sovereign
2020-03-16 17:44:35 <Taneb> Which requires... diplomacy
2020-03-16 17:44:45 <int-e> Agatha? Krosp, yes. Agatha... hmm.
2020-03-16 17:45:23 <int-e> Still having second thoughts, how does she stand it? It's so inefficient.

2020-03-16 18:02:36 <zzo38> Do audio tapes support index marks like VHS does? As far as I know, it doesn't, although I would think it would be a useful thing to have (or to fake it somehow).
2020-03-16 18:16:01 <int-e> "carnivorous" is an interesting word these days... needed two attempts to read it correctly :)
2020-03-16 18:16:25 <int-e> zzo38: weren't there some fancy tape recorders that could scan the tape for silence?
2020-03-16 18:19:40 <int-e> (That's how it worked when doing it manually anyway... wait for interruptions inbetween all the squeaking.)
2020-03-16 18:23:43 <zzo38> Maybe there is; I don't know. I think that there are four tracks (two on each side), so possibly one track could be used for index.

2020-03-16 21:06:17 <zzo38> Can <marquee> be disabled in Firefox? I am fine with <blink>, but I don't like <marquee>.
2020-03-16 21:20:18 <zzo38> Rosewater wrote about themes in Magic: the Gathering, including color, type, subtype, supertype, zone, and other possibilities.
2020-03-16 21:20:54 <zzo38> I thought, make the zone theme based on stack, ante, and command zone.
2020-03-16 21:49:24 <int-e> whatever happened to the battlefield and phasing
2020-03-16 21:50:13 <zzo38> Phasing is no longer a separate zone than the battlefield, although that can be a theme too I suppose
2020-03-16 21:57:46 <b_jonas> I'm trying to draw a tiny bitmap font where characters are 6 pixels high. so now I have to research which accented letters languages use, because I have to make some of the following characters look identical: a-grave, a-acute, a-circumflex, a-diaresis, a-tilde, a-brevis, a-macron, a-dotabove.
2020-03-16 21:58:14 <b_jonas> I decided early that o-circumflex and o-doubleacute can look the same, that's the easy part.
2020-03-16 21:58:42 <b_jonas> And I don't think this font will be usable for vietnamese,
2020-03-16 21:59:51 <b_jonas> and it would be better if the same accent looks the same on most vowels
2020-03-16 22:03:39 <b_jonas> so I have to be concerned with french/welsh that distinguishes e-acute, e-grave, e-circumflex, e-diaresis; portugese which distinguishes a-acute, a-grave, a-circumflex, a-tilde; romanian that distinguishes a-brevis from a-circumflex; swedish/finnish which distinguishes a-umlaut from a-ring; icelandic that distinguishes o-acute from o-diaresis;
2020-03-16 22:07:45 <b_jonas> as well as some romanizations of non-latin scripts, in particular the ISO 9 transcription of russian which distinguishes e-circumflex from e-diaresis (ok that's not a new constraint); I can probably give up on chinese pinyin transcription just as on vietnamese; what else am I forgetting?
2020-03-16 22:12:10 <b_jonas> oh yeah, also czech distinguishes u-acute from u-ring.
2020-03-16 22:15:02 <b_jonas> I think I'll do the following: grave is left pixel, acute is right pixel, umlaut/diaresis is left and right pixels, circumflex or double acute is middle and right pixel, tilde is left and middle pixel, macron is left and middle and right pixels, ring or brevis or middle dot is middle pixel alone, and I'll figure out what to do with the caron later, it has to be distinct from the middle dot and the acute
2020-03-16 22:15:08 <b_jonas> obviously
2020-03-16 22:15:57 <b_jonas> no wait, that won't work, darn it
2020-03-16 22:16:14 <b_jonas> the i with brevis has to differ from the i
2020-03-16 22:16:44 <b_jonas> for latin

2020-03-16 22:18:38 <b_jonas> still, brevis as the middle dot is too mnemonic to give up. I might just special case the i with brevis
2020-03-16 22:25:37 <b_jonas> ideally I should have a big table prepared for this that shows what letters each language and writing system that I commonly encounter use
2020-03-16 22:29:57 <zzo38> I also thought a theme based on a supertype, could be world, and you can do more than what other sets have previously done, such as adding death triggers, world cards other than global enchantments, effects that add or remove the world supertype, that suppress the world rule temporarily, count world cards in some zone, etc.
2020-03-16 22:31:42 <b_jonas> I actually have such a table for cyrillic, with five languages using cyrillic script, the serbian latin transcription, and the ISO 9 transcription (these two agree on every letter I think, but note that romanizations of ukranian differ, because —ñ vs –∏ vs —ã)
2020-03-16 22:36:23 <b_jonas> I can probably just use similar diacritics on most consonants: acute is right pixel, circumflex is middle and right pixels, dot above is middle pixel, and I think I'll mostly mark a caron with the left and middle pixel, except I'll have to figure out what to do with l/L/t/T with diacritics, those are ugly not only because there are so many diacritics that apply, but even the base letters are hard to
2020-03-16 22:36:29 <b_jonas> draw properly in small sizes and distinguishable from each other and i and c

2020-03-16 22:51:08 <b_jonas> oh yeah, the constraint is that this font should be somewhat readable to others, not just to me who knows what the font has, although of course my aesthetic decisions matter more
