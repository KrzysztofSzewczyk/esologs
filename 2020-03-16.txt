2020-03-16 01:13:44 <zzo38> ZZT itself is now Free software (the source code has been reconstructed), but you will still need Turbo Pascal to compile it, so it is still "trapped". You will also need LZEXE. Doing this allegedly produces the same ZZT.EXE file as the original; the only difference may be how the source code is formatted, and the comments and possibly variable names and so on.

2020-03-16 01:19:16 <int-e> zzo38: didn't Borland make the Pascal compiler free at some point? Or do you need a specific older version?
2020-03-16 01:21:11 <int-e> (that's free as in beer, though)
2020-03-16 01:22:04 <zzo38> Yes, it is freeware now, but not free software. (Still, it is a DOS program, so it is possible that you might not care.)

2020-03-16 01:32:39 <int-e> Hooloovo0: nah it was properly released... not just exploiting the fact that nobody's coming after you for your copyright violation
2020-03-16 01:32:57 <Hooloovo0> oh, that's cool
2020-03-16 01:37:31 <int-e> hrm. CTRL-F9     Kill dosbox.
2020-03-16 01:37:42 <int-e> whose bright idea was that ;)
2020-03-16 01:38:19 <zzo38> You could disable it if you do not want that, I suppose.
2020-03-16 01:38:51 <int-e> (CTRL-F9 runs programs in the Borland Pascal IDE)
2020-03-16 01:39:53 <zzo38> I wanted to make it to use the "context menu" key instead of CTRL for this purpose, although if you save that into the configuration file, then it won't work. Does the new version fix this?

2020-03-16 01:57:25 <kmc> ah
2020-03-16 01:57:37 <kmc> but every modern CPU can run a plain emulator like dosbox faster than any original DOS machine, right?
2020-03-16 01:57:56 <int-e> Yes.
2020-03-16 02:00:20 <int-e> The BP IDE doesn't even run in the dosemu... some dpmi problem. Works in dosbox though.
2020-03-16 02:01:36 <kmc> huh
2020-03-16 02:03:12 <int-e> http://int-e.eu/~bf3/tmp/bpc.png <-- looks weird
2020-03-16 02:05:00 <int-e> But who knows. I may have misconfigured something, and I cannot really be bothered to debug this.
2020-03-16 02:06:32 <int-e> Especially given the alternative that works.
2020-03-16 02:29:32 <zzo38> Someone said they were considering updating NNTP for 2020, and posted a proposal to the IETF. I suggested increasing article numbers from 31-bits to 63-bits, and adding the WHOAMI command, both of these features I have implemented in my own software. Maybe the IETF will make this official.

2020-03-16 02:32:24 <ais523> hearing that Turbo Pascal is now available in perpetual free-trial form is pretty encouraging
2020-03-16 02:32:29 <ais523> I still have some old Pascal code from a while back
2020-03-16 02:32:46 <ais523> I remember translating it into C but the C ran more slowly; that surprised me at the time and still surprises me now
2020-03-16 02:32:54 <ais523> maybe the Pascal had a better optimiser, or faster supporting libraries, or something
2020-03-16 02:34:59 <ais523> oh wow, this pascal source is so old that the file ends with a literal ^Z character
2020-03-16 02:35:06 <ais523> how long ago was it that text files stopped needing those?
2020-03-16 02:35:55 <int-e> I'm not sure, was it when we abandoned CP/M?
2020-03-16 02:35:56 <zzo38> Maybe Pascal is faster because it is DOS.
2020-03-16 02:36:05 <ais523> the C compiler was also DOS
2020-03-16 02:36:09 <ais523> I think, at least
2020-03-16 02:39:07 <ais523> oh wow, the executable I compiled from the Pascal source still runs (in DOSBox)
2020-03-16 02:39:08 <zzo38> Yes, although Pascal may be more suitable for DOS, at least in real mode.
2020-03-16 02:39:13 <ais523> I guess that's not a surprise
2020-03-16 02:39:35 <ais523> the executable I compiled from the C source does not run â€“ it's missing dependencies â€“ and I guess the problem is that those dependencies appear to be manually linked
2020-03-16 02:39:44 <ais523> which could be very slow given that the pixels are written individually with function calls
2020-03-16 02:40:02 <zzo38> What graphics mode?
2020-03-16 02:40:43 <ais523> it looks like 16-color 640×480 VGA
2020-03-16 02:41:02 <int-e> CP/M was a good guess, it seems; I vaguely remembered the record-based file access (which DOS mimics in its FCB interface for backward compatibility). "The CP/M file system only recorded the lengths of files in multiples of 128-byte "records", so by convention a Control-Z character was used to mark the end of meaningful data if it ended in the middle of a record."...
2020-03-16 02:41:07 <int-e> ...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-file
2020-03-16 02:42:27 <zzo38> Yes, although I don't know why it should be ^Z, since that isn't the ASCII code for end of file; ^D might make more sense
2020-03-16 02:42:45 <int-e> But Z is the last letter of the alphabet.
2020-03-16 02:43:04 <int-e> . o O ( It's the latin omega. )
2020-03-16 02:44:09 <zzo38> Yes, although it stands for "substitute" and not "end of file", isn't it?
2020-03-16 02:45:08 <int-e> Whatever that means.
2020-03-16 02:46:44 <ais523> the intended use was as an equivalent of REPLACEMENT CHARACTER
2020-03-16 02:46:47 <zzo38> I think "substitute" means there is no valid character, so it substitutes ^Z in its place.
2020-03-16 02:46:50 <ais523> `unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER
2020-03-16 02:46:52 <HackEso> â€‹ï¿½
2020-03-16 02:47:20 <ais523> but it was mostly used for other purposes, and Unicode had to add a separate such character at U+FFFD
2020-03-16 02:47:52 <int-e> Well, I remember that ^A and ^B displayed smileys. That's not in line with ASCII either. I don't think CP/M and DOS developers cared all that much.
2020-03-16 02:48:16 <ais523> int-e: code page 437 assigns glyphs for characters in the C0 and C1 regions, in addition to G0 and G1
2020-03-16 02:48:22 <int-e> (Or the PC BIOS developers which may be the actual people responsible?)
2020-03-16 02:48:24 <zzo38> Yes, in the PC character set, the graphics at those points corrsepond to faces.
2020-03-16 02:48:27 <ais523> the C0 characters are very hard to write on most output devices
2020-03-16 02:48:48 <ais523> the C1 characters are incompatible with most of the relevant standards, but are used often enough that terminals often need to find a way to output them anyway
2020-03-16 02:49:25 <zzo38> That is true of all of the control range; there are also graphics there on a PC, so that if you write directly to the video memory, they will be visible.
2020-03-16 02:50:08 <int-e> Whatever. CP/M and by extention DOS used ^Z to mark the end of files. That's really where the discussion should've ended.
2020-03-16 02:50:33 <ais523> policing topicality here can be kind-of hard :-D
2020-03-16 02:50:35 <int-e> Unless you have a time machine.
2020-03-16 02:50:36 <zzo38> Yes, that is probably why DOS does that, because of CP/M.
2020-03-16 02:50:45 <ais523> and retrocomputing is closer to our main topic than much of what's discussed here
2020-03-16 02:51:08 <int-e> ais523: I'm mostly annoyed at myself for participating in it beyond that point :)
2020-03-16 02:51:09 <ais523> I've actually put thought into writing an esolang for retrocomputing purposes
2020-03-16 02:51:32 <ais523> the main aim being to reduce the amount of RAM that a program written in it takes to run, as far as possible
2020-03-16 02:51:35 <zzo38> Yes, and even in esolang wiki there is a few retrocomputing stuff. And, I do want to see your esolang for retrocomputing purposes once you write it.
2020-03-16 02:52:03 <ais523> using any trick available; overlays, swapping to disk, using bytecode interpreters with compressed bytecode, etc.
2020-03-16 02:52:27 <ais523> I didn't design most of the details
2020-03-16 02:52:46 <ais523> one idea I had was for it to be a byte-compiled language where the bytecode used return-oriented programming
2020-03-16 02:52:58 <ais523> as a method of compression in addition to a method of function calls
2020-03-16 02:54:51 <ais523> another idea I had was to store all values as 1 byte on the stack, if they were more than 1 byte wide then a hash table element would be tied to the stack location and contain the real value, with the stack containing information to find the element
2020-03-16 02:55:09 <ais523> you could probably do something similar with the heap
2020-03-16 02:56:15 <ais523> but these are just ideas, and that's all I have, it's not like there's some big plan that I'm hiding
2020-03-16 02:56:33 <zzo38> OK
2020-03-16 02:57:15 <zzo38> I like those ideas
2020-03-16 02:58:41 <zzo38> (I thought of the similar idea about return-oriented programming before, too)
2020-03-16 02:59:24 <ais523> I'm actually surprised that return-oriented programming isn't done more often as a programming technique in cases where you don't have to use it
2020-03-16 02:59:36 <ais523> (of course, for the exploits against W^X code, it's often necessary)
2020-03-16 02:59:57 <ais523> I guess Underload has some similarities to return-oriented programming
2020-03-16 03:00:05 <ais523> although there are a lot of differences too
2020-03-16 03:02:45 <int-e> ais523: I imagine it's rather expensive because it messes up the builtin call-stack based branch prediction.
2020-03-16 03:03:03 <ais523> int-e: that's not necessarily the case if using a bytecode interpreter
2020-03-16 03:03:10 <int-e> (of modern CPUs)
2020-03-16 03:03:23 <ais523> but yes, it seems likely you'd have a lot of mispredicted branches
2020-03-16 03:03:29 <ais523> that doesn't matter so much in retrocomputing, though
2020-03-16 03:04:37 <int-e> I've certainly played funny tricks with the stack in golfing assembly code
2020-03-16 03:05:19 <int-e> (well, machine code is what was golfed, really, but I wrote it in assembly) really, but I
2020-03-16 03:06:24 <int-e> ... ^J (line feed = return key) is next to ^K (delete until end of line)
2020-03-16 03:06:43 <int-e> I've had so many IRC editing accidents because of this.
2020-03-16 03:06:44 <ais523> well, you normally don't linefeed mid-line anyway
2020-03-16 03:07:10 <ais523> oh, I see, you're trying to delete to the end of the line, but press ^J by mistake
2020-03-16 03:07:17 <int-e> Yes.
2020-03-16 03:07:20 <ais523> my most common accident of that nature is hitting Return instead of Backspace
2020-03-16 03:07:43 <ais523> (which are, again, adjacent, and you need to reach a long way to hit backspace, over Return)
2020-03-16 03:07:48 <int-e> Hmm. Wrong keyboard layout for this, \ is between backspace and return here.
2020-03-16 03:07:56 <ais523> I guess you could reach for the left-hand side of Backspace
2020-03-16 03:08:02 <int-e> This often happens involuntarily though:\
2020-03-16 03:08:13 <ais523> no, I mean I could
2020-03-16 03:08:15 <ais523> to avoid the issue
2020-03-16 03:08:36 <ais523> but spoke ambiguously because basically nobody uses "one" as a pronoun nowadays and none of the common replacements are really satisfactory
2020-03-16 03:09:38 <int-e> ais523: the "you" didn't affect what I typed at all :)
2020-03-16 03:10:18 <int-e> I was just trying to relate to the problem and realized that I no longer have this particular one.
2020-03-16 03:11:02 <ais523> ais523- was using a laptop that was dropped ~3 years ago as an emergency replacement
2020-03-16 03:11:16 <ais523> the keyboard layout was very similar to my current layout except that home/end were swapped with pgup/pgdn
2020-03-16 03:11:28 <int-e> yuck
2020-03-16 03:11:36 <int-e> why do people get creative on that front...
2020-03-16 03:11:57 <ais523> (also it was using a bootable USB stick as the OS because I didn't want to substantially change the existing filesystem (for archival purposes), and its existing OS hadn't been updated in 3 years)
2020-03-16 03:12:14 <ais523> I felt that merited half an underscore
2020-03-16 03:12:34 <int-e> Is this a weak form of vendor lockin?
2020-03-16 03:12:46 <ais523> it could be, I guess
2020-03-16 03:12:53 <int-e> You /could/ use any laptop but half of them will confuse you with their keyboard layout?
2020-03-16 03:12:58 <ais523> I actually abandoned the old vendor (HP) because I didn't like its UEFI implementation
2020-03-16 03:13:28 <ais523> hmm, should the pronoun be "their" rather than "its"? I never did decide whether a company is singular or plural
2020-03-16 03:14:37 <ais523> the biggest offences of the implementation appeared to be a) making the secure boot variables read-only whenever they were edited once, until you did a full reset of the secure boot state
2020-03-16 03:14:44 <int-e> I'd probably go for "their". But I also use singular "their" for gender-neutral means.
2020-03-16 03:15:04 <ais523> b) resetting the default bootloader to Windows's bootloader whenever you went into the UEFI settings
2020-03-16 03:15:08 <int-e> Though in this case I imagine a company as a group of people.
2020-03-16 03:15:28 <ais523> I think it's fairly well established that companies don't have genders and don't use pronouns that are intended only for people
2020-03-16 03:15:48 <ais523> so gender-neutrality isn't really an issue in this context, just singular/plural
2020-03-16 03:16:00 <int-e> Oh yeah I remember having to jump through some hoops to boot Linux on my former work HP Elite notebook.
2020-03-16 03:16:07 <ais523> I guess an Agoran "eir" wouldn't be that out of place, corporations act like people in some respects after all, and "eir" is appropriate for non-human people
2020-03-16 03:16:39 <ais523> I think it's interesting that most Linux distributions don't add themselves to Windows' bootloader, it would seem like a logical thing to do
2020-03-16 03:17:01 <ais523> (so that you could use either shim+GRUB, or Windows Boot Manager, based on personal preference; and yet boot into all your OSes either way)
2020-03-16 03:18:36 <zzo38> If you use both Linux and Windows, then yes it can make sense I think
2020-03-16 03:19:20 <ais523> I think it's interesting that the common Linux implementation has bootloaders stacked 3 deep
2020-03-16 03:19:44 <int-e> speaking of booting... why do I have 17 linux kernel images installed :/
2020-03-16 03:19:52 <ais523> (firmware UEFI â†’ shim â†’ grub), and if you have a multiboot setup this stacks bootloaders 4 deep (because grub chain-loads Windows Boot Manager)
2020-03-16 03:20:12 <ais523> not all these levels are actually needed
2020-03-16 03:21:03 <int-e> And why doesn't debian remove them all and then rebuild the initrds once.
2020-03-16 03:21:24 <zzo38> I think UEFI isn't very good
2020-03-16 03:21:31 <ais523> shim is a complicated compromise
2020-03-16 03:21:34 <int-e> zzo38: whatever
2020-03-16 03:22:23 <ais523> basically, it's a consequence of UEFI mandating an executable format that a) can only contain one digital signature and b) shipping with only Microsoft's key by default
2020-03-16 03:22:34 <ais523> b) isn't part of the standard, it's just what happens in practice
2020-03-16 03:23:04 <ais523> so it exists purely to validate a bootloader against someone else's key and then chain-load it
2020-03-16 03:23:36 <ais523> the various Linux distros persuade Microsoft to sign versions of shim that recognise their key, which is easier than trying to persuade every motherboard manufacturer to recognise their key
2020-03-16 03:24:25 <int-e> Hmm, with grubx64.efi isn't it just UEFI -> grub?
2020-03-16 03:24:36 <ais523> int-e: whose signature does grub have?
2020-03-16 03:25:06 <ais523> in my experience, distros put a signed version of grub into the UEFI bootloaders directory, but the UEFI refuses to load it unless someone manually changes the list of approved keys
2020-03-16 03:25:08 <int-e> Oh. You want actual secure boot?
2020-03-16 03:25:16 <ais523> why not?
2020-03-16 03:25:24 <int-e> It's fine.
2020-03-16 03:25:42 <int-e> And it explains the role of shim, I suppose.
2020-03-16 03:26:00 <ais523> one of the many ideas I've had and will never have time to act on, is a UEFI program that lets the user manage keys manually, choosing who to trust and who not to trust
2020-03-16 03:26:14 <ais523> together with kernels that check the filesystem for integrity during boot (at least, the parts they execute)
2020-03-16 03:26:50 <ais523> you wouldn't need much more than a signed md5sums file and a more secure hashing algorithm than md5
2020-03-16 03:28:52 <ais523> I guess an extreme version would require some sort of password to set files as +xâ€¦
2020-03-16 03:29:24 <ais523> (under the control of the user, of course)

2020-03-16 04:30:55 <ais523> hi shinh
2020-03-16 05:04:10 <ais523> question to everyone: I invented an esolang just to write one program, and have now written the program, but haven't implemented the esolang
2020-03-16 05:04:18 <ais523> should I implement the esolang, or just compile the program by hand?
2020-03-16 05:10:31 <zzo38> What program and what esolang?
2020-03-16 05:21:41 <ais523> I'm talking in general terms here
2020-03-16 05:21:53 <ais523> I'll be putting it up on the wiki once I'm sure it works
2020-03-16 05:23:22 <ais523> actually, screw it, I'll upload the program
2020-03-16 05:23:58 <ais523> here's the program: http://nethack4.org/pastebin/spiral-rise.wck
2020-03-16 05:24:22 <ais523> it's an esolang interpreter (for a new esolang called Spiral Rise) written in another new esolang (called Waterfall Construction Kit)
2020-03-16 05:24:28 <ais523> WCK is meant to compile to The Waterfall Model
2020-03-16 05:24:57 <ais523> and is currently defined by that one example program, which is its purpose for existence
2020-03-16 05:26:22 <ais523> I think the program is correct, although I'm not sure, it's pretty hard to test
2020-03-16 05:26:36 <ais523> I think I'm going to try compiling it by hand
2020-03-16 05:26:55 <zzo38> O, OK. I think that it is worth at least documenting WCK properly.
2020-03-16 05:49:02 <ais523> what's 310031-in-base-5 in decimal?
2020-03-16 05:50:46 <zzo38> If you mean 310031 is a base five number, then the decimal is 10016. (You can figure out this by dc easily. It can also be figured out easily in JavaScript and also in PostScript.)
2020-03-16 05:51:17 <ais523> I thought dc might be able to do it, but I wasn't sure how
2020-03-16 05:51:33 <ais523> thanks for the answer, anyway, you interpreted the question correctly
2020-03-16 05:51:56 <zzo38> How to do in dc is: 5i310031p
2020-03-16 05:54:33 <ais523> `dc 5i310031p
