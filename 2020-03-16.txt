2020-03-16 01:13:44 <zzo38> ZZT itself is now Free software (the source code has been reconstructed), but you will still need Turbo Pascal to compile it, so it is still "trapped". You will also need LZEXE. Doing this allegedly produces the same ZZT.EXE file as the original; the only difference may be how the source code is formatted, and the comments and possibly variable names and so on.

2020-03-16 01:19:16 <int-e> zzo38: didn't Borland make the Pascal compiler free at some point? Or do you need a specific older version?
2020-03-16 01:21:11 <int-e> (that's free as in beer, though)
2020-03-16 01:22:04 <zzo38> Yes, it is freeware now, but not free software. (Still, it is a DOS program, so it is possible that you might not care.)

2020-03-16 01:22:21 <Hooloovo0> yeah, it sounds like it's abandonware

2020-03-16 01:32:39 <int-e> Hooloovo0: nah it was properly released... not just exploiting the fact that nobody's coming after you for your copyright violation
2020-03-16 01:32:57 <Hooloovo0> oh, that's cool
2020-03-16 01:37:31 <int-e> hrm. CTRL-F9     Kill dosbox.
2020-03-16 01:37:42 <int-e> whose bright idea was that ;)
2020-03-16 01:38:19 <zzo38> You could disable it if you do not want that, I suppose.
2020-03-16 01:38:51 <int-e> (CTRL-F9 runs programs in the Borland Pascal IDE)
2020-03-16 01:39:53 <zzo38> I wanted to make it to use the "context menu" key instead of CTRL for this purpose, although if you save that into the configuration file, then it won't work. Does the new version fix this?

2020-03-16 01:57:25 <kmc> ah
2020-03-16 01:57:37 <kmc> but every modern CPU can run a plain emulator like dosbox faster than any original DOS machine, right?
2020-03-16 01:57:56 <int-e> Yes.
2020-03-16 02:00:20 <int-e> The BP IDE doesn't even run in the dosemu... some dpmi problem. Works in dosbox though.
2020-03-16 02:01:36 <kmc> huh
2020-03-16 02:03:12 <int-e> http://int-e.eu/~bf3/tmp/bpc.png <-- looks weird
2020-03-16 02:05:00 <int-e> But who knows. I may have misconfigured something, and I cannot really be bothered to debug this.
2020-03-16 02:06:32 <int-e> Especially given the alternative that works.
2020-03-16 02:29:32 <zzo38> Someone said they were considering updating NNTP for 2020, and posted a proposal to the IETF. I suggested increasing article numbers from 31-bits to 63-bits, and adding the WHOAMI command, both of these features I have implemented in my own software. Maybe the IETF will make this official.

2020-03-16 02:32:24 <ais523> hearing that Turbo Pascal is now available in perpetual free-trial form is pretty encouraging
2020-03-16 02:32:29 <ais523> I still have some old Pascal code from a while back
2020-03-16 02:32:46 <ais523> I remember translating it into C but the C ran more slowly; that surprised me at the time and still surprises me now
2020-03-16 02:32:54 <ais523> maybe the Pascal had a better optimiser, or faster supporting libraries, or something
2020-03-16 02:34:59 <ais523> oh wow, this pascal source is so old that the file ends with a literal ^Z character
2020-03-16 02:35:06 <ais523> how long ago was it that text files stopped needing those?
2020-03-16 02:35:55 <int-e> I'm not sure, was it when we abandoned CP/M?
2020-03-16 02:35:56 <zzo38> Maybe Pascal is faster because it is DOS.
2020-03-16 02:36:05 <ais523> the C compiler was also DOS
2020-03-16 02:36:09 <ais523> I think, at least
2020-03-16 02:39:07 <ais523> oh wow, the executable I compiled from the Pascal source still runs (in DOSBox)
2020-03-16 02:39:08 <zzo38> Yes, although Pascal may be more suitable for DOS, at least in real mode.
2020-03-16 02:39:13 <ais523> I guess that's not a surprise
2020-03-16 02:39:35 <ais523> the executable I compiled from the C source does not run â€“ it's missing dependencies â€“ and I guess the problem is that those dependencies appear to be manually linked
2020-03-16 02:39:44 <ais523> which could be very slow given that the pixels are written individually with function calls
2020-03-16 02:40:02 <zzo38> What graphics mode?
2020-03-16 02:40:43 <ais523> it looks like 16-color 640×480 VGA
2020-03-16 02:41:02 <int-e> CP/M was a good guess, it seems; I vaguely remembered the record-based file access (which DOS mimics in its FCB interface for backward compatibility). "The CP/M file system only recorded the lengths of files in multiples of 128-byte "records", so by convention a Control-Z character was used to mark the end of meaningful data if it ended in the middle of a record."...
2020-03-16 02:41:07 <int-e> ...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-file
2020-03-16 02:42:27 <zzo38> Yes, although I don't know why it should be ^Z, since that isn't the ASCII code for end of file; ^D might make more sense
2020-03-16 02:42:45 <int-e> But Z is the last letter of the alphabet.
2020-03-16 02:43:04 <int-e> . o O ( It's the latin omega. )
2020-03-16 02:44:09 <zzo38> Yes, although it stands for "substitute" and not "end of file", isn't it?
2020-03-16 02:45:08 <int-e> Whatever that means.
2020-03-16 02:46:44 <ais523> the intended use was as an equivalent of REPLACEMENT CHARACTER
2020-03-16 02:46:47 <zzo38> I think "substitute" means there is no valid character, so it substitutes ^Z in its place.
2020-03-16 02:46:50 <ais523> `unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER
2020-03-16 02:46:52 <HackEso> â€‹ï¿½
2020-03-16 02:47:20 <ais523> but it was mostly used for other purposes, and Unicode had to add a separate such character at U+FFFD
2020-03-16 02:47:52 <int-e> Well, I remember that ^A and ^B displayed smileys. That's not in line with ASCII either. I don't think CP/M and DOS developers cared all that much.
2020-03-16 02:48:16 <ais523> int-e: code page 437 assigns glyphs for characters in the C0 and C1 regions, in addition to G0 and G1
2020-03-16 02:48:22 <int-e> (Or the PC BIOS developers which may be the actual people responsible?)
2020-03-16 02:48:24 <zzo38> Yes, in the PC character set, the graphics at those points corrsepond to faces.
2020-03-16 02:48:27 <ais523> the C0 characters are very hard to write on most output devices
2020-03-16 02:48:48 <ais523> the C1 characters are incompatible with most of the relevant standards, but are used often enough that terminals often need to find a way to output them anyway
2020-03-16 02:49:25 <zzo38> That is true of all of the control range; there are also graphics there on a PC, so that if you write directly to the video memory, they will be visible.
2020-03-16 02:50:08 <int-e> Whatever. CP/M and by extention DOS used ^Z to mark the end of files. That's really where the discussion should've ended.
2020-03-16 02:50:33 <ais523> policing topicality here can be kind-of hard :-D
2020-03-16 02:50:35 <int-e> Unless you have a time machine.
2020-03-16 02:50:36 <zzo38> Yes, that is probably why DOS does that, because of CP/M.
2020-03-16 02:50:45 <ais523> and retrocomputing is closer to our main topic than much of what's discussed here
2020-03-16 02:51:08 <int-e> ais523: I'm mostly annoyed at myself for participating in it beyond that point :)
2020-03-16 02:51:09 <ais523> I've actually put thought into writing an esolang for retrocomputing purposes
2020-03-16 02:51:32 <ais523> the main aim being to reduce the amount of RAM that a program written in it takes to run, as far as possible
2020-03-16 02:51:35 <zzo38> Yes, and even in esolang wiki there is a few retrocomputing stuff. And, I do want to see your esolang for retrocomputing purposes once you write it.
2020-03-16 02:52:03 <ais523> using any trick available; overlays, swapping to disk, using bytecode interpreters with compressed bytecode, etc.
2020-03-16 02:52:27 <ais523> I didn't design most of the details
2020-03-16 02:52:46 <ais523> one idea I had was for it to be a byte-compiled language where the bytecode used return-oriented programming
2020-03-16 02:52:58 <ais523> as a method of compression in addition to a method of function calls
2020-03-16 02:54:51 <ais523> another idea I had was to store all values as 1 byte on the stack, if they were more than 1 byte wide then a hash table element would be tied to the stack location and contain the real value, with the stack containing information to find the element
2020-03-16 02:55:09 <ais523> you could probably do something similar with the heap
2020-03-16 02:56:15 <ais523> but these are just ideas, and that's all I have, it's not like there's some big plan that I'm hiding
2020-03-16 02:56:33 <zzo38> OK
2020-03-16 02:57:15 <zzo38> I like those ideas
2020-03-16 02:58:41 <zzo38> (I thought of the similar idea about return-oriented programming before, too)
2020-03-16 02:59:24 <ais523> I'm actually surprised that return-oriented programming isn't done more often as a programming technique in cases where you don't have to use it
2020-03-16 02:59:36 <ais523> (of course, for the exploits against W^X code, it's often necessary)
2020-03-16 02:59:57 <ais523> I guess Underload has some similarities to return-oriented programming
