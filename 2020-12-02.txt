2020-12-02 00:43:40 <fizzie> I'm half-expecting day 2 to have some sort of vaguely esolang-y recurring theme again.

2020-12-02 00:48:07 <int-e> and then there's the matter of researching your destination when traveling...
2020-12-02 00:48:19 <int-e> I feel that the story is kind of weak this year :P

2020-12-02 00:50:29 <fizzie> Hmm. I was pretty sure I had been using my GitHub account to log in to this thing, but now that I did, I can only see the two stars from 2020, and 4 from 2017 somehow. (Not sure if I just abandoned it in 2017.)
2020-12-02 00:50:39 <fizzie> Maybe I used the Google account instead, after all.
2020-12-02 00:51:55 <fizzie> Yeah, that one has 50 stars from 2019. Hmm. Can't decide which one to stick with.
2020-12-02 00:53:04 <int-e> alternate!
2020-12-02 00:53:23 <fizzie> Maybe I'll stick with the Google account, it's got some actual points from day 10 of 2019 when I was accidentally awake at 5am and did it real-time.
2020-12-02 00:53:36 <int-e> I totally overengineered the first day solutions.
2020-12-02 00:54:29 <int-e> (I wrote the first program before downloading the input and seeing that it was only 200 lines.)
2020-12-02 00:54:33 <fizzie> I didn't, but I spent time refactoring my 2019 Go repository to better fit multiple years in the same repo.
2020-12-02 00:55:07 <int-e> 2019 didn't have a repo.
2020-12-02 00:55:31 <int-e> 2020 does, if I keep up committing
2020-12-02 00:55:41 <fizzie> I had three for 2019. ;)
2020-12-02 00:55:58 <int-e> two commits so far: 2 stars/add .gitignore
2020-12-02 00:56:05 <int-e> three, hmm
2020-12-02 00:56:26 <int-e> I copied a lot of code around in 2019, that is a form of versioning, right?
2020-12-02 00:57:50 <fizzie> I had one with super-scrappy Python solutions but with ridiculously extensive (Markdown) notes about the problems and solutions; the Go one, which did a little bit of software-engineering-y stuff like unit tests for everything (well, almost); and the third one for that Processing.js thing, but I only did two days there.

2020-12-02 01:01:26 <int-e> And the day 25 version is different because I added some ad-hoc tracing... I don't even remember why :)
2020-12-02 01:01:40 <fizzie> (log1 = log --oneline --decorate=full --graph)
2020-12-02 01:02:34 <fizzie> My day 25 change seems to have been to add an `ascii` IO mode so I could play the adventure game "manually".
2020-12-02 01:02:43 <int-e> https://paste.debian.net/1175186/
2020-12-02 01:03:13 <int-e> I could do that without modifying the compiler... thanks to lazy evaluation I think
2020-12-02 01:03:49 <fizzie> http://ix.io/2Gd9 -- in the best Python style of "just stick some string in there instead of the expected type of object".
2020-12-02 01:03:56 <int-e> And I had abbreviations for n,e,s,w,t=take,d=drop.
2020-12-02 01:04:20 <fizzie> The queue.Queue in there was for running those multithreaded intcode things actually multithreaded, I think. :)
2020-12-02 01:05:09 <int-e> hah
2020-12-02 01:05:56 <int-e> (map (fromIntegral . ord) (unlines ts)) <-- "ASCII mode"
2020-12-02 01:07:25 <fizzie> Someone's starred the fungot repo 21 days ago. :)
2020-12-02 01:07:25 <fungot> fizzie: he knew they had galloped into ephebe. he should be killed. there's something honest about slaves and whips. well... i'm just going out,' said agnes.
2020-12-02 01:07:37 <fizzie> fungot: That's a little harsh, don't you think?
2020-12-02 01:07:37 <fungot> fizzie: " inadvisably, sir." vimes relaxed a bit,' it said. " you know you said it would help if you think of me
2020-12-02 01:07:39 <int-e> Ah!
2020-12-02 01:07:47 <int-e> The tracing was for the weight comparisons.
2020-12-02 01:08:55 <int-e> So I could see which numbers were compared, and determine individual weights and target weight
2020-12-02 01:09:01 <fizzie> My day 25 solution just brute-forces the door by doing itertools.combinations(items, size) and spamming drop/take as required.
2020-12-02 01:09:49 <int-e> Yeah I never did that :)
2020-12-02 01:10:52 <int-e> But I don't recall how I found the relevant locations... quite possibly I traced *all* SLT instructions at some point

2020-12-02 01:11:36 <int-e> I'm not sure what github was thinking when they added those suggestions.
2020-12-02 01:12:10 <fizzie> Probably just to show they're not so stodgy and serious.
2020-12-02 01:12:52 <int-e> Imagine just taking that suggestion whenever you create a new repo...
2020-12-02 01:13:29 <int-e> I guess it's not my kind of humor.
2020-12-02 01:13:41 <int-e> memorability is important, brevity is not
2020-12-02 01:14:01 <int-e> (you can always check the thing out under a shorter name)
2020-12-02 01:14:09 <fizzie> Huh. I've got uncommitted changes in the Python repo.
2020-12-02 01:14:36 <fizzie> They seem to be all just going from 'foo {} bar'.format(baz) to f'foo {baz} bar' though.
2020-12-02 01:20:56 <fizzie> https://github.com/fis/aoc-py/blob/main/readme.md -- no idea why I wrote all of that, there's nothing particularly clever about any of the solutions.

2020-12-02 01:31:49 <myname> so nobody did write an intcode interpreter in intcode yet?
2020-12-02 01:32:09 <fizzie> I think interest in Intcode kind of petered out post-AoC.
2020-12-02 01:32:55 <myname> yeah it's not that interesting
2020-12-02 01:32:56 <fizzie> I remember I was writing annotated disassembly of the puzzle Intcode programs, with the intent of maybe adding them to the article (at least as links), but probably gave up.
2020-12-02 01:32:57 <int-e> Same here.

2020-12-02 01:33:33 <int-e> fizzie: Oh I actually finished a disassembly of mine (the day 25 one).
2020-12-02 01:33:49 <int-e> I'm sure I shared it back then
2020-12-02 01:34:14 <fizzie> Probably. I think we also argued a bit about the best conventions for Intcode assembly, but I didn't finish (or even really start) the assembler.
2020-12-02 01:34:49 <int-e> I think in the end it's too normal.
2020-12-02 01:36:34 <fizzie> Looks like I've actually finished commenting the disassembled versions of days 5, 7 and 13, but did not commit them.
2020-12-02 01:36:55 <fizzie> Day 13 was that breakout clone.

2020-12-02 01:43:52 <int-e> I had INCB
2020-12-02 01:44:14 <int-e> the register was called "relative base", right
2020-12-02 01:44:18 <fizzie> Right, it had some logic like that.
2020-12-02 01:44:23 <int-e> so that's "relative base offset"
2020-12-02 01:44:39 <int-e> (that's my guess at least)
2020-12-02 01:45:09 <int-e> they don't seem to be a fan of adding verbs like "set" to the mnemonic

2020-12-02 01:48:05 <fizzie> I was planning to implement the syntax http://ix.io/25xa but didn't.
2020-12-02 01:48:27 <fizzie> It used `*x` for mode 0, a naked `x` for mode 1 and the same `@x` for mode 2.
2020-12-02 01:48:27 <int-e> hmm, actually that's a surprisingly low level language
2020-12-02 01:48:44 <fizzie> Somehow @ makes a lot of sense for the relative addressing mode.

2020-12-02 15:42:25 <fizzie> Yeah, it's just that day 2 last year did introduce Intcode.
2020-12-02 15:44:05 <int-e> fizzie: which was odd in that it was an even numbered day
2020-12-02 15:44:28 <int-e> shachaf: 301 islands now
2020-12-02 15:45:28 <int-e> Does this game ever end? (I've seen a likely ending spot though. In fact I guessed that through the clouds because it looks like the start. But now I've been close and seen a boat waiting there.)
2020-12-02 15:46:08 <int-e> (However, there were some rocks blocking it off... and then the float I came in on took me far, far away again.)
2020-12-02 15:47:52 <int-e> half of the islands are (or seem to be, for now) fillers anyway, serving as bridges between more interesting ones
2020-12-02 15:56:31 <Taneb> int-e: where are you with so many islands? (what game are you playing?)
