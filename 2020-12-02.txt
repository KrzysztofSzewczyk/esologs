2020-12-02 00:42:02 <zzo38> It is still fully supported, and I will still use it in custom cards.
2020-12-02 00:42:37 <fizzie> int-e: Oh, I missed that.
2020-12-02 00:43:40 <fizzie> I'm half-expecting day 2 to have some sort of vaguely esolang-y recurring theme again.

2020-12-02 00:47:04 * int-e is wondering how the payment for the first day problem is supposed to work
2020-12-02 00:47:38 <int-e> "look at this poor guy doing his own expenses, he must be completely out of luck, here, have a gold starfish"
2020-12-02 00:48:07 <int-e> and then there's the matter of researching your destination when traveling...
2020-12-02 00:48:19 <int-e> I feel that the story is kind of weak this year :P
2020-12-02 00:48:33 <fizzie> Well, maybe it'll have a twist.
2020-12-02 00:48:35 <int-e> s/when/before/
2020-12-02 00:49:19 <int-e> Or maybe this is the travel preparation? Hmm. Maybe.
2020-12-02 00:50:29 <fizzie> Hmm. I was pretty sure I had been using my GitHub account to log in to this thing, but now that I did, I can only see the two stars from 2020, and 4 from 2017 somehow. (Not sure if I just abandoned it in 2017.)
2020-12-02 00:50:39 <fizzie> Maybe I used the Google account instead, after all.
2020-12-02 00:51:55 <fizzie> Yeah, that one has 50 stars from 2019. Hmm. Can't decide which one to stick with.
2020-12-02 00:53:04 <int-e> alternate!
2020-12-02 00:53:23 <fizzie> Maybe I'll stick with the Google account, it's got some actual points from day 10 of 2019 when I was accidentally awake at 5am and did it real-time.
2020-12-02 00:53:36 <int-e> I totally overengineered the first day solutions.
2020-12-02 00:54:29 <int-e> (I wrote the first program before downloading the input and seeing that it was only 200 lines.)
2020-12-02 00:54:33 <fizzie> I didn't, but I spent time refactoring my 2019 Go repository to better fit multiple years in the same repo.
2020-12-02 00:55:07 <int-e> 2019 didn't have a repo.
2020-12-02 00:55:31 <int-e> 2020 does, if I keep up committing
2020-12-02 00:55:41 <fizzie> I had three for 2019. ;)
2020-12-02 00:55:58 <int-e> two commits so far: 2 stars/add .gitignore
2020-12-02 00:56:05 <int-e> three, hmm
2020-12-02 00:56:26 <int-e> I copied a lot of code around in 2019, that is a form of versioning, right?
2020-12-02 00:57:50 <fizzie> I had one with super-scrappy Python solutions but with ridiculously extensive (Markdown) notes about the problems and solutions; the Go one, which did a little bit of software-engineering-y stuff like unit tests for everything (well, almost); and the third one for that Processing.js thing, but I only did two days there.
