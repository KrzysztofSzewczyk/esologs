2019-11-13 00:04:02 <shachaf> I wonder how many system calls Linux would have if you got rid of all the obsolete ones.
2019-11-13 00:06:56 <ais523> my asm/unistd_64.h lists 332 total, the vast majority of them seem to be neither removed nor superseded, so I'm guessing about 300?
2019-11-13 00:07:22 <shachaf> Mine has 436.
2019-11-13 00:07:41 <shachaf> I suspect quite a few are superseded.
2019-11-13 00:07:41 <ais523> I think there might be debates about what counts as obsolete
2019-11-13 00:07:54 <ais523> sorting them alphabetically, I came across dup/dup2/dup3
2019-11-13 00:07:56 <b_jonas> yeah, eg. is read obsolete because we have preadv?
2019-11-13 00:08:00 <ais523> which of those would you consider obsolete?
2019-11-13 00:08:11 <b_jonas> ais523: dup, dup2 are definitely obsolete, just use the fcntl functions
2019-11-13 00:08:19 <shachaf> dup3 clearly supersedes dup2.
2019-11-13 00:08:26 <shachaf> dup isn't superseded as far as I know.
2019-11-13 00:08:42 <b_jonas> dup3 too has an fcntl equivalent
2019-11-13 00:08:45 <ais523> dup is entirely duplicated by fcntl
2019-11-13 00:08:48 <shachaf> Of course the Linux ABI is much bigger than system calls. It include /proc and /sys, and ioctls, and so on.
2019-11-13 00:08:53 <ais523> and dup3 can be written in terms of dup2 + fcntl
2019-11-13 00:09:16 <b_jonas> hmm wait
2019-11-13 00:09:18 <ais523> /proc and /sys and friends can only be accessed via system calls
2019-11-13 00:09:26 <ais523> they're more like special cases of system calls, than ABIs in their own right
2019-11-13 00:09:29 <b_jonas> fcntl doesn't do the dup2/dup3 explicit destination file descriptor number thing?
2019-11-13 00:09:32 <b_jonas> sorry
2019-11-13 00:09:42 <ais523> b_jonas: no
2019-11-13 00:09:59 <ais523> although you can do a dup+cloexec mix using a single fcntl instruction

2019-11-13 00:10:11 <ais523> which doesn't have a dedicated system call of its own otherwise (dup3 can't do it)
2019-11-13 00:10:36 <ais523> this ABI is actually something of a mess, but I guess backwards compatibility (and to some extent usabliity from asm without wrappers) is important
2019-11-13 00:13:29 <shachaf> If foo() is replaced with foo2() which has a flags argument, clearly foo is obsolete.
2019-11-13 00:13:41 <shachaf> Similarly foo with fooat.
2019-11-13 00:14:19 <ais523> what if the flags are rarely used, and technically unnecessary?
2019-11-13 00:15:14 <shachaf> It should've had the flags argument in the first place.
2019-11-13 00:15:16 <ais523> dup3 is probably not entirely redundant to dup2 + fcntl (there are likely some race conditions relating to exec in one thread against dup in another), but it's only weird situations where you'd need it
2019-11-13 00:15:39 <ais523> and in practice it's more likely to be used as an optimisation to reduce system call overhead
2019-11-13 00:16:01 <shachaf> You mean CLOEXEC?
2019-11-13 00:16:22 <shachaf> All the system calls that make fds are getting flags arguments to support CLOEXEC.
2019-11-13 00:16:24 <ais523> dup3 only supports one flag ;-)
2019-11-13 00:16:46 <shachaf> That seems like a good reason to call the nonflag version obsolete.
2019-11-13 00:17:37 <ais523> I would expect dup2(x,y) to be preferred over dup3(x,y,z) if you didn't want to set cloexec
2019-11-13 00:18:38 <ais523> fwiw, this is probably a good argument for all system calls to have a flags argument, even if it's initially just always-0?

2019-11-13 00:19:18 <ais523> hmm, is the Linux system call ABI guaranteed to preserve registers, other than eax? I vaguely remember that it is
2019-11-13 00:19:32 <ais523> in which case dup2 has less register pressure, in addition to not needing to zero an additional register
2019-11-13 00:19:48 <shachaf> It clobbers rcx and r11.
2019-11-13 00:19:59 <ais523> oh right, everything clobbers r11
2019-11-13 00:20:11 <shachaf> Why?
2019-11-13 00:20:43 <ais523> in practice, r11 very rarely /actually/ changes as the result of a call, but it's been considered useful to have a register that dynamic linkers and other similar things can use as a temporary if they need to inject glue code for some sort of call or another
2019-11-13 00:21:01 <ais523> like, at any change of control, you have a register that's safe to clobber no matter what
2019-11-13 00:21:14 <ais523> and r11 is the generally agreed-on choice for that
2019-11-13 00:21:22 <ais523> (it helps if everyone uses the same register, for obvious reasons!)
2019-11-13 00:21:46 <shachaf> I guess this is a SysV thing.

2019-11-13 00:22:20 <ais523> it probably started from there, at least
2019-11-13 00:22:43 <shachaf> I think calling files in /proc a special case of the ABI of open()/read() is a big stretch.
2019-11-13 00:23:13 <ais523> $ readlink /proc/self/exe
2019-11-13 00:23:14 <ais523> /bin/readlink
2019-11-13 00:23:19 <ais523> if that isn't a special case, I don't know what is
2019-11-13 00:23:28 <ais523> err, wrong one
2019-11-13 00:23:58 <ais523> I meant /proc/self/fd/0 and friends
2019-11-13 00:24:18 <shachaf> Oh man, I forgot Linux had name_to_handle_at and open_by_handle_at.
2019-11-13 00:24:59 <ais523> (the point being that if a process has a deleted file open, readlink on that file returns the name it had before that name was deleted, but you can nonetheless read the file directly by fd)
2019-11-13 00:25:20 <shachaf> I mean, /proc is obviously part of the ABI, but in a really bad way, and I don't think putting the blame on read is reasonable.
2019-11-13 00:25:24 <ais523> actually that probably works on /proc/self/exe too if a deleted executable is running
2019-11-13 00:25:44 <ais523> my point is that this is a special case relating to the combination of readlink and proc, you won't find anything like it elsewhere
2019-11-13 00:25:58 <ais523> and this is because proc is basically just a set of special case for system calls
2019-11-13 00:28:17 <shachaf> I'm confused by the name_to_handle_at API.
2019-11-13 00:28:48 <shachaf> Oh, never mind, I didn't read far enough.
2019-11-13 00:30:58 <shachaf> whoa, Linux has process_vm_{read,write}v
2019-11-13 00:32:06 <shachaf> It's also finally getting pidfd, apparently.
2019-11-13 00:32:58 <ais523> process_vm_{read,write}v look like a huge efficiency gain for debuggers, and probably have other uses as well
2019-11-13 00:33:23 <ais523> reading a target process' memory in tiny chunks via ptrace would have huge system call overhead
2019-11-13 00:33:54 <shachaf> Was it previously possible to read /proc/pid/mem?
2019-11-13 00:34:11 <ais523> hmm, I didn't think of that
2019-11-13 00:37:10 <fizzie> Ooh, pidfd.
2019-11-13 00:37:52 <fizzie> There are so many foofd's in Linux; signalfd, eventfd, timerfd.
2019-11-13 00:38:05 <ais523> what's the intended use case of a pidfd?
2019-11-13 00:38:19 <ais523> at a guess, some sort of protection against PID reuse?
2019-11-13 00:38:25 <shachaf> Avoiding race conditions, I imagine.
2019-11-13 00:38:52 <fizzie> Yes, sending a signal to a known process without worrying about it dying and being replaced by some other process is the one I know of.
2019-11-13 00:39:03 <fizzie> Also waiting for a process to exit without being its parent, maybe?
2019-11-13 00:39:21 <ais523> (or its ptracer)
2019-11-13 00:39:47 <ais523> actually, you can also wait for a process to exit without being its parent /or/ its ptracer by ptracing its parent, but that's probably a bit silly
2019-11-13 00:42:03 <ais523> hmm, the man page for ptrace has been updated since I last read it

2019-11-13 00:42:59 <ais523> there's a discussion of permissions, including the mention that ptrace permission checks are based on the ptracer's real UID/GID, not its effective UID/GID (which seems like a minor security risk in the case where the ptracer is trying to suspend its own permissions)

2019-11-13 00:43:44 <fizzie> This article says there's also a proposal for a clone flag that can make a process that can only be waited on through its pidfd, the intention being that a library can create a helper process without confusing its host application's wait calls.

2019-11-13 00:45:19 <fizzie> For a Go application I wrote recently (for personal use), I did a really ugly-looking snippet to use ambient capabilities, before learning that actually the standard Go library's syscall.SysProcAttr struct has an AmbientCaps field for using ambient capabilities.
2019-11-13 00:46:36 <shachaf> The man page for wait4 says that waitpid and waitid are preferred.
2019-11-13 00:46:53 <shachaf> But neither one of them gives you rusage, like wait4 does!
2019-11-13 00:47:24 <shachaf> Except that's not true.
2019-11-13 00:47:36 <shachaf> The system call gives you rusage, but the glibc wrapper just ignores it.

2019-11-13 00:53:10 <ais523> I think it would be helpful if there were some sort of model of OS-level capabilities, plus any similar constructs at below the OS level, in terms that users could easily understand
2019-11-13 00:54:06 <shachaf> When will Linux support mmap into a ptracee?
2019-11-13 00:54:15 <ais523> in particular, there seems to be some sort of hierarachy of cans that override can'ts that override cans that override can'tsâ€¦
2019-11-13 00:54:27 <shachaf> Windows has supported this forever.
2019-11-13 00:54:38 <ais523> like, file-permitted is the strongest sort of capability, it says that the file can do this, overriding everything else
2019-11-13 00:54:47 <shachaf> Without mmap you can't even guarantee finding a syscall instruction to do anything else.

2019-11-13 01:00:01 <ais523> removing a capability from the bounding set absolutely prevents that capability from ever again being regained by file-inheritable; however, it does not prevent it being regained from file-permitted
2019-11-13 01:02:04 <fizzie> Yeah, it's not super-obvious.
2019-11-13 01:02:09 <ais523> AFAICT, capabilities is currently a mix between several different permissions models, with system calls to choose which ones you want, and/or to prevent your descendant processes using their own system calls to change back to a different one
2019-11-13 01:02:24 <ais523> except that the kernel doesn't force you to pick a specific model but sort of lets you blend your way between them if you like
2019-11-13 01:02:41 <fizzie> There's that table in capabilities(7) on how the ambient, permitted, effective, inheritable and bounding sets are derived on execve.
2019-11-13 01:03:31 <fizzie> But even that wasn't the full story.
2019-11-13 01:04:45 <ais523> I think a sane model would look something like "processes: permitted is always a subset of inheritable; files: only inheritable permissions exist"
2019-11-13 01:06:23 <ais523> actually, I think you need a new category entirely
2019-11-13 01:07:05 <ais523> I think files should have two permission sets: one is equivalent to "inheritable" in the current model, the other causes the process executed from that file to gain a permission as permitted if it is both inheritable and effective in the calling process
2019-11-13 01:07:19 <fizzie> Anyway, all I wanted was to have one capability-aware program execute a capability-dump helper process with CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH, and I think I got that setup right: for the capability-aware executable file, set that bit in the file's effective and permitted sets; in the capability-aware program, first add the bit to the process's inheritable set, then raise it in the process's ambient set.
2019-11-13 01:08:16 <ais523> files don't hav effective sets
2019-11-13 01:08:28 <ais523> just the effective bit, which could be called the "capability-unaware" bit
2019-11-13 01:09:24 <ais523> hmm, how does the no-new-privs bit interact with all this?
2019-11-13 01:10:48 <fizzie> Right, that's what I meant.
2019-11-13 01:11:15 <fizzie> Arguably, it's no surprise capabilities haven't really conquered the world yet.
2019-11-13 01:12:21 <ais523> if a capability-aware program A is trying to execute a capability-unaware program B with a particular capability set, AFAICT all it needs to do is to put the capability set into its own ambient set, with no changes to B needed
2019-11-13 01:12:48 <fizzie> Well, it also needs to put the capability into its own inheritable set, but you might consider that a part of putting it into its own ambient set.
2019-11-13 01:13:09 <fizzie> (If it wasn't there already, that is.)
2019-11-13 01:13:17 <fizzie> (It won't be there already if it's coming from a file.)
2019-11-13 01:13:18 <ais523> yes, that's part of ambient
2019-11-13 01:13:50 <ais523> actually, what confuses me is that inheritable seems to be at all-0s for unprivileged processes
2019-11-13 01:14:47 <ais523> this gives it a /really/ niche use; its only purpose is for a privileged program to call unprivileged helper programs in such a way that they can call file-inheritable programs in a privileged way
2019-11-13 01:16:19 <ais523> I can't think of circumstances where that would be useful, and thus suspect that inheritable capabilites aren't currently used much
2019-11-13 01:17:29 <fizzie> That's what I think too. https://lwn.net/Articles/636533/ calls them "broken". (The proposal for ambient capabilities.)
2019-11-13 01:20:34 <ais523> I think a bounding set on fP (in that article's notation) is useful, but oddly neither pI nor X actually bound it
2019-11-13 01:20:38 <ais523> I don't think anything can bound that
2019-11-13 01:21:04 <ais523> other than NNP, obviously, which has to outrank /everything/ to be usable securely

2019-11-13 01:44:47 <zzo38> How to run PHP5 on Raspberry Pi?
2019-11-13 01:45:01 <imode> zzo38: is there a package in the raspbian repos?
2019-11-13 01:45:30 <imode> sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 ?
2019-11-13 01:45:45 <ais523> you shouldn't need apache to run PHP?
2019-11-13 01:45:58 <ais523> only if you want to use it for CGI scripts
2019-11-13 01:46:16 <ais523> I guess that's a common use, but my first thought was PHP as a standalone programming language rather than as part of a web server
2019-11-13 01:46:18 <oerjan> ais523: well it seems obvious to me that the length 1 block representation needs to be the same length as the basic production sequence
2019-11-13 01:46:32 <zzo38> I only want to run PHIRC, which is the IRC client I have. (My internet doesn't work, so I use this other computer instead, which has wireless internet.)
2019-11-13 01:46:37 <imode> you shouldn't need apache, you can use anything else, however I'm under the assumption that-
2019-11-13 01:46:39 <imode> nevermind.
2019-11-13 01:46:46 <imode> you should just be able to install php5 then.
2019-11-13 01:47:28 <zzo38> It says "package php5 has no installation candidate"
2019-11-13 01:47:36 <imode> what distro are you running on the pi.
2019-11-13 01:48:06 <ais523> zzo38: does it have to be PHP 5 specifically, or is a newer version OK?
2019-11-13 01:48:36 <zzo38> I think many things will break with PHP 7, which is what it currently has
2019-11-13 01:49:29 <zzo38> I suppose I can try to see if the program works, but it might not work
2019-11-13 01:50:20 <ais523> the easiest way is probably to get a package for an old version of PHP from the Debian archives, see http://snapshot.debian.org/ for details
2019-11-13 01:50:54 <imode> php5 should be a package in raspbian...
2019-11-13 01:50:54 <ais523> although, it might not work with modern dependencies
2019-11-13 01:51:06 <ais523> php5 is really old though
2019-11-13 01:51:23 <ais523> it's probably dropped out of the archives by now
2019-11-13 01:51:28 <imode> sure, but it's still a required package.
2019-11-13 01:51:55 <ais523> it's possible that it has a minor version number in the archives
2019-11-13 01:52:01 <oerjan> ais523: anyway, i cut and pasted into vim and rotated lines, and it seemed to fit that way.
2019-11-13 01:52:24 <imode> zzo38: sudo apt-cache search php I guess.
2019-11-13 01:52:29 <imode> you don't need the sudo iirc.
2019-11-13 01:52:33 <ais523> nor the "-cache"
2019-11-13 01:52:47 <imode> been a long time since I used debian. arch main.
2019-11-13 01:53:09 <ais523> I think «apt show "php5*"» will be more useful
2019-11-13 01:53:53 <zzo38> I tried that; it says virtual
2019-11-13 01:53:56 <imode> huh, raspbian doesn't have a web-searchable package mirror.
2019-11-13 01:53:58 <imode> that's lame.
2019-11-13 01:54:09 <ais523> if they're all virtual it means that the package doesn't exist in the repositories any more
2019-11-13 01:54:20 <ais523> so you'll need to find an old version of the package, perhaps from an old version of the repositories
2019-11-13 01:54:26 <ais523> I think the assumption is that nobody would use php5 any more
2019-11-13 01:54:42 <ais523> python 1 isn't in the repositories either
2019-11-13 01:54:57 <imode> https://www.raspberryconnect.com/raspbian-packages/54-raspbian-php
2019-11-13 01:55:07 <imode> how old _is_ php5.
2019-11-13 01:55:34 <imode> oof, sec support in debian ended on new year's.
2019-11-13 01:55:35 <zzo38> Is there a program for Raspberry Pi to download Usenet messages to be read later on another computer?
2019-11-13 01:55:48 <ais523> 7.0 appears to be the oldest version available from there
2019-11-13 01:55:50 <imode> still in jesse, though..
2019-11-13 01:57:41 <ais523> 7.0 was released in 2015; 5.6 was the most current version before that (6 was abandoned)
2019-11-13 01:58:23 <imode> why was 6 abandoned?
2019-11-13 01:58:30 <ais523> 5.6 became unsupported at the end of 2018
2019-11-13 01:58:31 <imode> (feels like there's a joke there...)
2019-11-13 01:59:25 <ais523> apparently they started writing PHP 6 in 2008, and abandoned it in 2014 because it still wasn't finished by then
2019-11-13 01:59:39 <imode> perl6 and php6.
2019-11-13 01:59:40 <ais523> the main intended feature that they failed to implement for 6 was Unicode support
2019-11-13 02:00:11 <ais523> perl 6 was finished though, it's just that it's sufficiently different from perl 5 that many people prefer the original (including me)
2019-11-13 02:00:49 <ais523> and perl 6 eventually got renamed to reduce confusion, I think
2019-11-13 02:01:03 <oerjan> it's raku now
2019-11-13 02:01:27 * oerjan discovered the name change when he saw people editing that in his wikipedia watchlist
2019-11-13 02:02:07 <fizzie> The original's still being actively developed, as well.
2019-11-13 02:02:45 <zzo38> Yes, that can be a good idea, to call it something else, since it is something else. I think Inform7 should also be renamed because it is a different programming language from Inform

2019-11-13 03:00:41 <pikhq> I take it zzo38 is trying to use a Pi as a daily driver?
2019-11-13 03:02:25 User Name: imode = imode!~linear@unaffiliated/imode
2019-11-13 03:02:25 <imode> more power to him, tbh. always wanted to try a pi as a driver, if only to find a laptop case to put it in.
2019-11-13 03:02:57 <imode> with the raspi zero w or whatever, it's attractive. surprised a phone hasn't been made from it yet.
2019-11-13 03:03:18 <imode> the gpi case is a step in the right direction, though: http://retroflag.com/GPi-CASE.html
2019-11-13 03:13:17 <pikhq> It is a bit limited in some ways, but I'm pretty sure none of those limitations are a surprise to anyone
2019-11-13 03:13:32 <pikhq> Especially with the cost

2019-11-13 03:16:30 <imode> tbh using it as a thin client to access your actual workstation would be a great idea.
2019-11-13 03:16:37 <kmc> that's cute
2019-11-13 03:17:01 <kmc> imode: what would be the point of making a phone out of a DIY board based on a years-old phone SoC?
2019-11-13 03:17:07 <kmc> it's not even a particularly 'open' SoC
2019-11-13 03:17:16 <kmc> it's just another broadcom whatever
2019-11-13 03:18:30 <imode> kmc: it's cheap, I can buy it in bulk, and there's less I have to do to fix it. this is of course assuming there is a supply chain ready to hand you a "phone case" for a pi zero w.
2019-11-13 03:19:05 <imode> if there's an alternative SBC out there that has the same kind of adoption I'm down, I just haven't encountered it.
2019-11-13 03:21:15 <kmc> it's going to be less powerful than a 5 year old android phone and chunkier too
2019-11-13 03:22:19 * imode shrugs.
2019-11-13 03:22:37 <imode> power and chunkiness don't really concern me that much. I use a T430 thinkpad as my daily driver.
2019-11-13 03:22:52 <imode> would like a phone that's built like a toughbook.
