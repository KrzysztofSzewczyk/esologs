2020-02-05 00:00:20 <b_jonas> the second one iterates on the characters, where X goes from 0.5 to -2.0 in steps of 0.1

2020-02-05 00:00:58 <b_jonas> then there's a loop of only two steps, to get two pixels in one character of the output, that's the (P Y)(P(Y+ 0.1)) part
2020-02-05 00:01:13 <b_jonas> and those two outputs are turned to one character with the lookup table [0 0->" "|0 1->"."|1 0->"'"|1 1->":"]
2020-02-05 00:01:34 <spruit11> I'll save your explanation to a text file and think about it tomorrow.
2020-02-05 00:02:11 <b_jonas> and there's the inner loop, in which X and Y are constant, representing a complex number (X,Y), and we iterate for 11 steps, S is the step counter, and (U,V) is the complex number that changes
2020-02-05 00:02:25 <b_jonas> in each step, I square the complex number and add (X,Y) to it, which is the normal Mandelbrot loop
2020-02-05 00:03:20 <b_jonas> at the end of the inner loop, I extract a result from the final value of (U,V) with [true->1|_->0]((abs U)+(abs V)<2.0)
2020-02-05 00:03:34 <b_jonas> that result is 1 if the point is in the Mandelbrot set, or 0 if it isn't
2020-02-05 00:03:50 <b_jonas> I use 0 and 1 instead of true and false only to make the lookup table shorter to write
2020-02-05 00:04:08 <b_jonas> the second loop also concatenates the result characters
2020-02-05 00:04:19 <b_jonas> and the string that we get for that line is printed with the say function
2020-02-05 00:04:24 <b_jonas> that's about all there is to it
2020-02-05 00:04:53 <b_jonas> to choose the grid of X and Y samples, I stole the numbers from the J snippets
2020-02-05 00:10:01 <spruit11> Right, I am putting it into the examples dir.
2020-02-05 00:10:11 <spruit11> B. Jonas fine as a reference?
2020-02-05 00:10:41 <b_jonas> no, that's a messed up username that I ended up with after migration from the older wiki. please use b_jonas instead.
2020-02-05 00:11:07 <b_jonas> the older wiki was of a sort that wanted CamelCase pagenames, then those got converted to Camel Case
2020-02-05 00:11:25 <b_jonas> when they copied the content to a mediawiki
2020-02-05 00:11:57 <spruit11> Excellent.
2020-02-05 00:13:08 <spruit11> You want a link to a page you have. Only thing I got now is "b_jonas (freenode)". Not really descriptive.
2020-02-05 00:13:17 <spruit11> Unless you prefer anonymity.
2020-02-05 00:14:23 <spruit11> Okay, I am going with what I have now.

2020-02-05 01:01:31 <salpynx> Someone mentioned around NYE that there was no one from New Zealand in the channel. I was away from keyboards at that time so couldn't provide advance reports from 2020, but that's where I'm based.
2020-02-05 01:02:31 <salpynx> Awkward timezone explains why I tend to miss the interesting chats.
2020-02-05 01:02:53 <salpynx> @fungot what's new?
2020-02-05 01:02:54 <fungot> salpynx: what's a python editor?

2020-02-05 01:03:58 <salpynx> @fungot A person who edits other people's python? I did some of that today.
2020-02-05 01:03:59 <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @list
2020-02-05 01:03:59 <fungot> salpynx: what could be an omgrofl command i guess)
2020-02-05 01:05:47 <salpynx> That's a common reaction.
2020-02-05 01:06:49 <salpynx> @list
2020-02-05 01:06:50 <lambdabot> What module?  Try @listmodules for some ideas.
2020-02-05 01:07:39 <salpynx> lambdabot: fungot is more ... fun to talk to, sorry.
2020-02-05 01:07:39 <fungot> salpynx: an unspecified value." is the term " reference nets" in petri nets, and petri couldn't give a better answer, but in parts slightly outdated or implementation specific?

2020-02-05 01:47:34 <zzo38> Now I made loading PK fonts and it can render individual glyphs (typesetting paragraphs is not yet implemented).
2020-02-05 01:48:50 <zzo38> For typesetting text, will need to support ligatures, kerning, accented characters, multi-layer characters, paragraph line breaking, and what else should be needed? I may have missed some, although there is probably some things which is not needed.
2020-02-05 02:12:41 <salpynx> RTL / LTR text?

2020-02-05 02:32:36 <zzo38> I think in TeXnicard, there isn't a need to mix different text directions in the same paragraph (I also think even when used in other documents, it doesn't work so well, either). But still I should think it would be good to support different text directions, even if only one text direction per paragraph.
2020-02-05 02:48:44 <zzo38> Since it is specifically for typesetting text on a card (e.g. Magic: the Gathering), that may tell what features are more important to want.
2020-02-05 02:56:11 <zzo38> Also, due to having custom separations, if you want to render a page with custom separations into RGBA, there will need to be some way to define how to convert it. (There will also need to be the way to transmit the separations individually (in CMYK mode), when you want to print out the custom separations on a printer that supports separations.)
2020-02-05 03:02:32 <zzo38> Due to limitations in the Ghostscript display device, the maximum number of custom separations is four (these four are in addition to the CMYK process colours, so there are eight separations in total). Do you expect this to be sufficient? You should tell me if you think you will need more separations for some reason, and if you know what reason.
2020-02-05 03:17:51 <salpynx> where is the latest TeXnicard source? I found repo.or.cz but that is 7 years old. Interested because I am currently working on a number of esolang things involving .svg graphics, and have been using TeX for another, but mainly for maths typesetting.
2020-02-05 03:18:42 <zzo38> salpynx: It is available at the following Fossil repository: http://zzo38computer.org/fossil/texnicard.ui
2020-02-05 03:20:06 <zzo38> TeX is good for typesetting many kind of books whether or not you are using much mathematics. For doing vector graphics, PostScript works better; however, SVG is not an available output format in Ghostscript.
2020-02-05 03:20:25 <salpynx> TeX doesn't seem to be able to do arbitrary, nested, text scaling (which makes sense because that's not a practical typsetting problem), so svg seemed better for some of the things I was trying to do, but there might be something I could learn from.
2020-02-05 03:22:05 <zzo38> TeX is able to specify the scaling of fonts. For other effects, you can modify the METAFONT code for the fonts.
2020-02-05 03:23:35 <zzo38> What exactly are you trying to do anyways?
2020-02-05 03:27:37 <zzo38> Maybe then, we can see what to do about it.
2020-02-05 03:28:52 <salpynx> The scaling problem was to for a 2D text substitution to replace say one character with a block of typeset text at a scaled to occupy the area of the original character, theoretically recursive to any level
