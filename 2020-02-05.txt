2020-02-05 00:00:20 <b_jonas> the second one iterates on the characters, where X goes from 0.5 to -2.0 in steps of 0.1

2020-02-05 00:00:58 <b_jonas> then there's a loop of only two steps, to get two pixels in one character of the output, that's the (P Y)(P(Y+ 0.1)) part
2020-02-05 00:01:13 <b_jonas> and those two outputs are turned to one character with the lookup table [0 0->" "|0 1->"."|1 0->"'"|1 1->":"]
2020-02-05 00:01:34 <spruit11> I'll save your explanation to a text file and think about it tomorrow.
2020-02-05 00:02:11 <b_jonas> and there's the inner loop, in which X and Y are constant, representing a complex number (X,Y), and we iterate for 11 steps, S is the step counter, and (U,V) is the complex number that changes
2020-02-05 00:02:25 <b_jonas> in each step, I square the complex number and add (X,Y) to it, which is the normal Mandelbrot loop
2020-02-05 00:03:20 <b_jonas> at the end of the inner loop, I extract a result from the final value of (U,V) with [true->1|_->0]((abs U)+(abs V)<2.0)
2020-02-05 00:03:34 <b_jonas> that result is 1 if the point is in the Mandelbrot set, or 0 if it isn't
2020-02-05 00:03:50 <b_jonas> I use 0 and 1 instead of true and false only to make the lookup table shorter to write
2020-02-05 00:04:08 <b_jonas> the second loop also concatenates the result characters
2020-02-05 00:04:19 <b_jonas> and the string that we get for that line is printed with the say function
2020-02-05 00:04:24 <b_jonas> that's about all there is to it
2020-02-05 00:04:53 <b_jonas> to choose the grid of X and Y samples, I stole the numbers from the J snippets
2020-02-05 00:10:01 <spruit11> Right, I am putting it into the examples dir.
2020-02-05 00:10:11 <spruit11> B. Jonas fine as a reference?
2020-02-05 00:10:41 <b_jonas> no, that's a messed up username that I ended up with after migration from the older wiki. please use b_jonas instead.
2020-02-05 00:11:07 <b_jonas> the older wiki was of a sort that wanted CamelCase pagenames, then those got converted to Camel Case
2020-02-05 00:11:25 <b_jonas> when they copied the content to a mediawiki
2020-02-05 00:11:57 <spruit11> Excellent.
2020-02-05 00:13:08 <spruit11> You want a link to a page you have. Only thing I got now is "b_jonas (freenode)". Not really descriptive.
2020-02-05 00:13:17 <spruit11> Unless you prefer anonymity.
2020-02-05 00:14:23 <spruit11> Okay, I am going with what I have now.

2020-02-05 01:48:50 <zzo38> For typesetting text, will need to support ligatures, kerning, accented characters, multi-layer characters, paragraph line breaking, and what else should be needed? I may have missed some, although there is probably some things which is not needed.

2020-02-05 02:32:36 <zzo38> I think in TeXnicard, there isn't a need to mix different text directions in the same paragraph (I also think even when used in other documents, it doesn't work so well, either). But still I should think it would be good to support different text directions, even if only one text direction per paragraph.
2020-02-05 02:48:44 <zzo38> Since it is specifically for typesetting text on a card (e.g. Magic: the Gathering), that may tell what features are more important to want.
2020-02-05 02:56:11 <zzo38> Also, due to having custom separations, if you want to render a page with custom separations into RGBA, there will need to be some way to define how to convert it. (There will also need to be the way to transmit the separations individually (in CMYK mode), when you want to print out the custom separations on a printer that supports separations.)
2020-02-05 03:02:32 <zzo38> Due to limitations in the Ghostscript display device, the maximum number of custom separations is four (these four are in addition to the CMYK process colours, so there are eight separations in total). Do you expect this to be sufficient? You should tell me if you think you will need more separations for some reason, and if you know what reason.
2020-02-05 03:17:51 <salpynx> where is the latest TeXnicard source? I found repo.or.cz but that is 7 years old. Interested because I am currently working on a number of esolang things involving .svg graphics, and have been using TeX for another, but mainly for maths typesetting.
2020-02-05 03:18:42 <zzo38> salpynx: It is available at the following Fossil repository: http://zzo38computer.org/fossil/texnicard.ui
2020-02-05 03:20:06 <zzo38> TeX is good for typesetting many kind of books whether or not you are using much mathematics. For doing vector graphics, PostScript works better; however, SVG is not an available output format in Ghostscript.
2020-02-05 03:20:25 <salpynx> TeX doesn't seem to be able to do arbitrary, nested, text scaling (which makes sense because that's not a practical typsetting problem), so svg seemed better for some of the things I was trying to do, but there might be something I could learn from.
2020-02-05 03:22:05 <zzo38> TeX is able to specify the scaling of fonts. For other effects, you can modify the METAFONT code for the fonts.
2020-02-05 03:23:35 <zzo38> What exactly are you trying to do anyways?
2020-02-05 03:27:37 <zzo38> Maybe then, we can see what to do about it.
2020-02-05 03:28:52 <salpynx> The scaling problem was to for a 2D text substitution to replace say one character with a block of typeset text at a scaled to occupy the area of the original character, theoretically recursive to any level
2020-02-05 03:31:42 <zzo38> O, OK. It should be possible to do that with TeX, I think (as long as the aspect ratio of the glyphs is maintained), although such a thing probably isn't going to work so well. TeX doesn't support arbitrary precision, but neither does PostScript, and I don't know if SVG does or not.
2020-02-05 03:32:24 <salpynx> each of these text areas would have a position in its parent reference, but would itself potentially be a 'page' with its own layout. Effectively every symbol would be a character AND (potentially) a page
2020-02-05 03:34:45 <salpynx> svg seems to be able to do arbitrary level nesting or scaling, which is why it seemed a better choice for extreme scaling.
2020-02-05 03:34:47 <zzo38> TeX supports adding "specials" which you could use to represent whatever you want it to represent, such as links to other pages. PostScript doesn't, although I thought that they should add specials into level 4 PostScript, since it might be of use for some applications.
2020-02-05 03:36:19 <salpynx> For the 2D replacement, something like TeX would be nicer for the concept, even if there is a limit to the nesting level I'd try to use it.
2020-02-05 03:37:37 <zzo38> As I said, you could define a special for that purpose, and then use a specialized DVI viewer to use the page links to use arbitrary nesting/scaling.

2020-02-05 03:42:11 <salpynx> One of the things I've not fully completed or written up properly uses svgs with user defined units in Planck lengths to represent the source code. I haven't found a render that displays the objects properly with visible lines, but all the control points are in the correct places, and are converted to cm correctly. They validate as compliant svg.

2020-02-05 03:45:13 <zzo38> (And anyways, TeXnicard only produces raster output anyways, so is not suitable for what you are describing. But if you want to make up cards for games such as Magic: the Gathering or a card game you invent by yourself, and/or if you want to make the database of the cards too (and will want statistics and so on), and/or if you have used Magic Set Editor but want something better, then you should consider TeXnicard.)
2020-02-05 03:47:08 <salpynx> I thought maybe the dc syntax would let arbitrary shapes and symbols be drawn on the cards (which is similar to another thing I was playing with), but from reading the docs, that looks like that has been completely replaced in the latest version
2020-02-05 03:49:22 <zzo38> You can still do that using PostScript, which is still stack based programming. But neither version allows nesting to arbitrary levels.
2020-02-05 03:50:32 <zzo38> (TeXnicard now uses a combination of PostScript and SQL, and also has something called EVALUATE code for some things (currently only gradients for pictures, but in future may do other stuff too).)
2020-02-05 03:52:49 <salpynx> thanks for the 'special' tip I'll look into that. That looks like a way to get some basic output support using TeX, but still allowing for 'invisible' content to be present
2020-02-05 03:53:23 <zzo38> Do you know any PostScript programming? PostScript can draw arbitrary shapes/symbols on the cards better than the old dc syntax could, although there are also many additional features specific to TeXnicard (such as PK font rendering, alpha transparency, etc). All PostScript commands which can draw graphics on the page still work.

2020-02-05 03:54:16 <tswett[m]> Hey, anyone familiar with combinatorial game theory?
2020-02-05 03:54:22 <salpynx> I'm not a Magic: the Gathering fan, but I like the idea of custom card games, and games in general
2020-02-05 03:55:22 <tswett[m]> I'm wondering about a thing. Consider the game G = { Z | Z } — that is, either player may move to any integer.
2020-02-05 03:55:31 <tswett[m]> Is G + G + 1 = 0?
2020-02-05 03:56:17 <tswett[m]> Oh, I figured out the answer to my question in the process of typing it. The answer is no, it's equal to 1 and not 0.
2020-02-05 03:56:22 <zzo38> salpynx: Well, TeXnicard isn't only for Magic: the Gathering. However, it is meant for card games (maybe someone can find a use for something else too, but I do not know of any).
2020-02-05 03:56:26 <salpynx> No PostScript experience. I've only recently been teaching myself how to use LaTeX/TeX, which I like the idea of. PostScript doesn't excite me in the same way
2020-02-05 03:57:00 <salpynx> tswett[m]: glad we could help!
2020-02-05 03:57:19 <tswett[m]> Thanks. :D
2020-02-05 03:58:22 <zzo38> tswett[m]: I have read about surreal numbers and how it is work with the game theory. By the rule of addition, I suppose, can figure out the answer of such question.
2020-02-05 03:59:31 <tswett[m]> There's a simple proof that it can't be 0: if G + G + 1 were 0, that would mean that G + G = -1, but G + G is symmetrical about 0, so it can't be -1.
2020-02-05 04:00:00 <tswett[m]> I think that in fact, G + G = 0 and so G + G + 1 = 1.
2020-02-05 04:30:36 <zzo38> If a keyword action is added in Magic: the Gathering which applies to an object or player but successfully does nothing to that object or player (although things can trigger on it), what would such a keyword action be called?
