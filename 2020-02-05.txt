2020-02-05 00:00:20 <b_jonas> the second one iterates on the characters, where X goes from 0.5 to -2.0 in steps of 0.1

2020-02-05 00:00:58 <b_jonas> then there's a loop of only two steps, to get two pixels in one character of the output, that's the (P Y)(P(Y+ 0.1)) part
2020-02-05 00:01:13 <b_jonas> and those two outputs are turned to one character with the lookup table [0 0->" "|0 1->"."|1 0->"'"|1 1->":"]
2020-02-05 00:01:34 <spruit11> I'll save your explanation to a text file and think about it tomorrow.
2020-02-05 00:02:11 <b_jonas> and there's the inner loop, in which X and Y are constant, representing a complex number (X,Y), and we iterate for 11 steps, S is the step counter, and (U,V) is the complex number that changes
2020-02-05 00:02:25 <b_jonas> in each step, I square the complex number and add (X,Y) to it, which is the normal Mandelbrot loop
2020-02-05 00:03:20 <b_jonas> at the end of the inner loop, I extract a result from the final value of (U,V) with [true->1|_->0]((abs U)+(abs V)<2.0)
2020-02-05 00:03:34 <b_jonas> that result is 1 if the point is in the Mandelbrot set, or 0 if it isn't
2020-02-05 00:03:50 <b_jonas> I use 0 and 1 instead of true and false only to make the lookup table shorter to write
2020-02-05 00:04:08 <b_jonas> the second loop also concatenates the result characters
2020-02-05 00:04:19 <b_jonas> and the string that we get for that line is printed with the say function
2020-02-05 00:04:24 <b_jonas> that's about all there is to it
2020-02-05 00:04:53 <b_jonas> to choose the grid of X and Y samples, I stole the numbers from the J snippets
2020-02-05 00:10:01 <spruit11> Right, I am putting it into the examples dir.
2020-02-05 00:10:11 <spruit11> B. Jonas fine as a reference?
2020-02-05 00:10:41 <b_jonas> no, that's a messed up username that I ended up with after migration from the older wiki. please use b_jonas instead.
2020-02-05 00:11:07 <b_jonas> the older wiki was of a sort that wanted CamelCase pagenames, then those got converted to Camel Case
2020-02-05 00:11:25 <b_jonas> when they copied the content to a mediawiki
2020-02-05 00:11:57 <spruit11> Excellent.
2020-02-05 00:13:08 <spruit11> You want a link to a page you have. Only thing I got now is "b_jonas (freenode)". Not really descriptive.
2020-02-05 00:13:17 <spruit11> Unless you prefer anonymity.
2020-02-05 00:14:23 <spruit11> Okay, I am going with what I have now.

2020-02-05 00:39:48 <salpynx> agree, watching the live coding / language investigation unfold in the logs, the quine, and ending with the neat fractal code was very entertaining!

2020-02-05 01:01:31 <salpynx> Someone mentioned around NYE that there was no one from New Zealand in the channel. I was away from keyboards at that time so couldn't provide advance reports from 2020, but that's where I'm based.
2020-02-05 01:02:31 <salpynx> Awkward timezone explains why I tend to miss the interesting chats.
2020-02-05 01:02:53 <salpynx> @fungot what's new?
2020-02-05 01:02:54 <fungot> salpynx: what's a python editor?
2020-02-05 01:02:54 <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @list
2020-02-05 01:03:58 <salpynx> @fungot A person who edits other people's python? I did some of that today.
2020-02-05 01:03:59 <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @list
2020-02-05 01:03:59 <fungot> salpynx: what could be an omgrofl command i guess)
2020-02-05 01:05:47 <salpynx> That's a common reaction.
2020-02-05 01:06:49 <salpynx> @list
2020-02-05 01:06:50 <lambdabot> What module?  Try @listmodules for some ideas.
2020-02-05 01:07:39 <salpynx> lambdabot: fungot is more ... fun to talk to, sorry.
2020-02-05 01:07:39 <fungot> salpynx: an unspecified value." is the term " reference nets" in petri nets, and petri couldn't give a better answer, but in parts slightly outdated or implementation specific?

2020-02-05 01:47:34 <zzo38> Now I made loading PK fonts and it can render individual glyphs (typesetting paragraphs is not yet implemented).
2020-02-05 01:48:50 <zzo38> For typesetting text, will need to support ligatures, kerning, accented characters, multi-layer characters, paragraph line breaking, and what else should be needed? I may have missed some, although there is probably some things which is not needed.
