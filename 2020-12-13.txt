2020-12-13 00:49:23 <fizzie> Did days 1-9 of 2018 to get a little bit more context. Honestly they're not that dissimilar from this year, so I'm thinking 2019 was just very #esoteric-audience-appropriate year.
2020-12-13 01:01:00 <nakilon> I could not continue 2019 in Befunge https://github.com/Nakilon/adventofcode-befunge
2020-12-13 01:01:19 <nakilon> because the next task demanded dances with 'g' and 'p'
2020-12-13 01:02:15 <nakilon> that's why I finally started making my language and I'll continue solving 2019 in it
2020-12-13 01:02:58 <fizzie> I think we discussed how all those people who do the "every day a new language" challenge might've been a bit miffed about the whole Intcode thing.

2020-12-13 07:46:05 <shachaf> I think I'm at 192 or so.
2020-12-13 07:46:09 <shachaf> 197
2020-12-13 07:46:45 <shachaf> 513 sounds like way too many.
2020-12-13 07:49:50 <int-e> I think you'll need 300 or 350 to reach the end
2020-12-13 07:50:07 <int-e> but there's a lot of area to the sides
2020-12-13 07:51:02 <int-e> And it's worth reaching the end first... it lifts the global fog so you can assess the area where islands are
2020-12-13 07:51:26 <int-e> I hope that isn't a huge spoiler.
2020-12-13 07:52:11 <shachaf> You've mentioned it already, anyway.
2020-12-13 07:52:44 <int-e> (To my mind the fog is mainly fluff for flavor and guidance (see where you've been), not an essential part of the puzzles.)
2020-12-13 07:53:56 <shachaf> I think "there's more to do there" was more arguably a spoiler.
2020-12-13 07:54:05 <shachaf> Though I was just thinking along those lines myself anyway, seeing the footprints.
2020-12-13 07:54:21 <int-e> Yeah I thought of that as a spoiler.
2020-12-13 07:54:40 <int-e> Not a tremendously big one, but still.
2020-12-13 07:57:25 <shachaf> Hmm, I like the puzzle at 264,237

2020-12-13 08:13:12 <zzo38> Probably, the level compression of Free Hero Mesh should be improved. It is better than Hero Mesh (which doesn't compress and also is inefficient in its coding in other ways), but perhaps improvement could be made. I tried a few things that didn't work. (Maybe, if I try again 100 times then maybe it will eventually work, I don't know.)
2020-12-13 08:13:52 <shachaf> The series I was talking about seems to have the theme "push off of a non-rock".
2020-12-13 08:14:15 <int-e> zzo38: how many GB of data are you talking about
2020-12-13 08:14:45 <int-e> shachaf: ah, littering
2020-12-13 08:15:12 <zzo38> int-e: Less than one.
2020-12-13 08:15:39 <int-e> zzo38: so maybe it's not worth improving the compression for
2020-12-13 08:16:12 <zzo38> (But if a collection of many puzzle sets is made later, then there will be more.)
2020-12-13 08:16:47 <int-e> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren't_gonna_need_it
2020-12-13 08:17:56 <zzo38> int-e: Perhaps you are correct. Perhaps it can even be simplified from what it is now (although it can still be made more efficient than the EKS format, which uses 16-bit fields even though only 8-bits are needed).
2020-12-13 08:18:04 <shachaf> OK, enough for today.
2020-12-13 08:18:08 <shachaf> I'm at 224 islands.

2020-12-13 08:24:52 <shachaf> The main problem is that the talks themselves are recorded, and I don't want my voice in them.
2020-12-13 08:25:11 <shachaf> I did type a few questions that the speaker answered, before.
2020-12-13 08:25:25 <shachaf> Did I mention the surprising fact the speaker said?
2020-12-13 08:25:54 <shachaf> The fact is: For UNSAT instances, you should restart very frequently, and for SAT instances, you should restart infrequently.
2020-12-13 08:26:04 <shachaf> If you'd asked me to guess, I would've predicted the exact opposite.
2020-12-13 08:27:14 <int-e> hmm, yeah that feels counterintuitive.
2020-12-13 08:28:03 <zzo38> I will still need to fix the level compression anyways, since in one converted level, it results three Field objects at (7,1) even though there is supposed to be only two (although all but one is redundant anyways, but that is what it is in the original; it isn't my fault!)
2020-12-13 08:29:43 <int-e> I can rationalize the former a bit, I guess: maybe for UNSAT the idea is that when you take a fresh look at the problem you gain insights (learn clauses) that are unrelated to what you did before... and hence maybe more useful
2020-12-13 08:30:24 <int-e> rathet than comprehensively exploring a corner of the problem based on the first couple of choices you made.
2020-12-13 08:30:34 <int-e> *rather
2020-12-13 08:31:12 <int-e> And SAT might actually need a distinction between problems with few models and problems with plenty of them.
2020-12-13 08:33:48 <zzo38> What does UNSAT mean?
2020-12-13 08:34:34 <int-e> unsatisfactory... sorry, kidding. unsatisfiable
2020-12-13 08:35:13 <shachaf> int-e: My original intuition for restarting was, maybe you get stuck in some difficult and fruitless subtree for a long time, and if you'd just started with a slightly different guess you'd've found a solution immediately.
2020-12-13 08:35:25 <shachaf> But that seems more applicable to SAT than to UNSAT.
2020-12-13 08:35:37 <int-e> SAT and UNSAT are names for the yes and no answer of a (here: propositional) satisfiability problem.
2020-12-13 08:35:44 <shachaf> Yes.
2020-12-13 08:36:00 <shachaf> I mean, if there is a solution, it seems like maybe you can jump around and hope to find it.
2020-12-13 08:36:11 <shachaf> But if there isn't one then it seems like you'd need to be more exhaustive.
2020-12-13 08:36:15 <int-e> shachaf: Right, but one of the lessons here, I think, is that you really have to think in terms of learning.
2020-12-13 08:36:16 <zzo38> O, OK.
2020-12-13 08:36:19 <shachaf> Certainly for regular DPLL it seems like that's how it'd work.
2020-12-13 08:36:32 <shachaf> Right, I was about to say. It must be about clause learning things that I don't have a good feel for here.
2020-12-13 08:37:03 <shachaf> I meant "more applicable to SAT instances than to UNSAT instances".
2020-12-13 08:37:17 <int-e> Yeah I've been there :)
2020-12-13 08:38:16 <int-e> As you probably know there are randomized solvers that are only good for SAT instances... random walks are kind of continuous restarts
2020-12-13 08:39:03 <int-e> I don't know whether they're still better than CDCL solvers for SAT instances. They used to be.
2020-12-13 08:41:57 User Name: aaaaaa = aaaaaa!~ArthurStr@188.163.100.177
2020-12-13 08:41:57 <aaaaaa> int-e: WalkSAT. But only good for underconstrained problems. I.e., that can have many solutions. AFAIR!
2020-12-13 08:42:16 <aaaaaa> Like $n$ queens
2020-12-13 08:44:29 <shachaf> Randomized solvers as in local search?
2020-12-13 08:45:29 <shachaf> https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4413 makes the argument that CDCL solvers with very frequent restarts are very similar to local search.
2020-12-13 08:50:46 <int-e> That resonates... I may have seen or heard that idea before somewhere.
2020-12-13 08:51:09 <int-e> Can't place it though.

2020-12-13 09:02:19 <shachaf> I was thinking the big thing I need to do was VSIDS.
2020-12-13 09:02:33 <aaaaaa> shachaf: have you seen more SAT solvers like that to study? I already saw TAOCP 7.2.2.2 solvers...
2020-12-13 09:02:43 <int-e> 2017, hmm. Yeah I've probably seen it, glanced at it, balked at the coding style, and gone away. Oh, actually I seem to recall shachaf mentioning it here around the time they started on their own solver.
2020-12-13 09:02:46 <shachaf> But the talk the other day said that modern solvers can do as well as VSIDS with a relatively simple move-to-front heuristic.
2020-12-13 09:03:17 <shachaf> aaaaaa: Nothing that short.
2020-12-13 09:03:35 <aaaaaa> shachaf: maybe a bit longer :)
2020-12-13 09:03:39 <shachaf> I read some of the TAOCP solver code too.
2020-12-13 09:03:43 <shachaf> SAT13.pdf, I think.
2020-12-13 09:03:56 <shachaf> Of course I looked at minisat.
2020-12-13 09:04:09 <shachaf> Just think of prefixes that mean "small", add "sat" at the end, and see if you find something.
2020-12-13 09:04:19 <shachaf> picosat exists but I don't know much about it.
2020-12-13 09:04:35 <shachaf> http://bach.istc.kobe-u.ac.jp/lect/taocp-sat/knuth/pdf/sat13.pdf is the literate PDF.
2020-12-13 09:06:25 <aaaaaa> BTW, is there any good reason to use Knuth's literate style over commented code?
2020-12-13 09:07:35 <int-e> . o O ( Maybe if you like explaining your code more than writing it... )
2020-12-13 09:08:10 <aaaaaa> int-e: yes, for textbooks, for example. Like TAOCP itself.
2020-12-13 09:08:14 <zzo38> aaaaaa: Sometimes, I think. If the purpose is to describe the algorithms or the rules or something like that, I think that it can help; trying to describe it without the code is often not working as well, and just an ordinary program code is not so suitable for describing it.
2020-12-13 09:09:12 <aaaaaa> Can't a tool like Doxygen help it?
2020-12-13 09:09:42 <shachaf> I like the property of 2SAT that, if you make an incorrect guess, you'll always find that out through unit propagation.
2020-12-13 09:09:56 <shachaf> So you only need a stack of size 1.
2020-12-13 09:09:58 <int-e> My understanding of literate programming is that you're writing a text document from which a program can be extracted.
2020-12-13 09:10:27 <shachaf> String glob matching -- foo*bar*vaz -- also has that property, that you only need to backtrack to the most recent *
2020-12-13 09:10:38 <shachaf> Does it happen elsewhere?
2020-12-13 09:10:44 <zzo38> Doxygen is for making the documentation of each function and stuff in the program, not for explaining the algorithms, I think.
2020-12-13 09:10:58 <int-e> And the emphasis is on the text. I suppose you can use web as a fancier macro language. I haven't seen anybody do it, except Knuth.
2020-12-13 09:11:25 <shachaf> I don't like Doxygen-style documentation very much.
2020-12-13 09:11:37 <aaaaaa> int-e: yes, somehow, it's not popular at all. Knuth got it wrong?
2020-12-13 09:11:38 <shachaf> I'd rather read the source code comments directly in most cases.
2020-12-13 09:11:59 <zzo38> I don't like Doxygen much either, actually.
2020-12-13 09:12:04 <int-e> shachaf: it's a theme in some classic dynamic programming tasks, like finding the longest increasing subsequence
2020-12-13 09:12:25 <int-e> aaaaaa: I don't think he got it wrong.
2020-12-13 09:12:38 <int-e> aaaaaa: It seems to have worked brilliantly for himself.
2020-12-13 09:12:52 <int-e> But most people aren't Knuth.
2020-12-13 09:12:53 <shachaf> Knuth says that thanks to literate programming he's able to write more complicated programs than he would otherwise.
2020-12-13 09:13:07 <aaaaaa> int-e: another his tool is TeX, which has immense popularity
2020-12-13 09:14:22 <int-e> Well, LaTeX more than plain TeX.
2020-12-13 09:14:48 <zzo38> Yes, LaTeX is used much more, although a few people (including myself, and also Knuth) use Plain TeX.
2020-12-13 09:15:12 <int-e> Because LaTeX liberates you from having to think about string processing and stuff like catcodes.
2020-12-13 09:15:19 <aaaaaa> zzo38: is there any good reason to try plain TeX over LaTeX?
2020-12-13 09:15:37 <shachaf> Can you teach me any kittycatcodes?
2020-12-13 09:15:58 <int-e> `? procrastination
2020-12-13 09:16:00 <HackEso> The Procrastination is destined to rule the world... right after watching this final funny cat clip on youtube.
2020-12-13 09:16:26 <shachaf> I suppose kissat has kittycatcodes.
2020-12-13 09:16:36 <zzo38> aaaaaa: Well, I find it less confusing, at least. I think also it is more likely to work in future because it is not going to be changed so much
2020-12-13 09:16:40 <int-e> well that one is a literal cat
2020-12-13 09:16:57 <int-e> not to be confused with a literate cat
2020-12-13 09:17:08 <int-e> or a littering cat
2020-12-13 09:17:13 <int-e> or a cat litter
2020-12-13 09:17:14 <aaaaaa> zzo38: OK. Any TeX sources to learn from, except from Knuth's website?
2020-12-13 09:17:24 <int-e> (too silly?)
2020-12-13 09:17:29 <shachaf> You could read the TeXbook presumably.
2020-12-13 09:17:37 <aaaaaa> shachaf: yeah, forgot about it
2020-12-13 09:18:15 <zzo38> Yes, that is my idea too, is to read the TeXbook.
2020-12-13 09:19:51 <int-e> there are also some attempts of reconstruction like https://doi.org/10.1017/S0956796897002840
2020-12-13 09:20:32 <int-e> or maybe this copy https://www.rw.cdl.uni-saarland.de/people/heckmann/private/abstracts/neuform.html
2020-12-13 09:21:19 <int-e> Though that is on the typesetting end, not on the esolang end of TeX.
2020-12-13 09:22:12 <zzo38> My "Scientific Role Playing System" is written with Plain TeX. I also added macros to make cross-references, table of contents, etc. You could look at it to use as the example for your own use, if you want to do, I suppose.
2020-12-13 09:22:40 <zzo38> (I also included fonts with unslanted Greek alphabets, in case you need that.)
2020-12-13 09:25:30 <aaaaaa> zzo38: URL?
2020-12-13 09:26:32 <zzo38> The Fossil repository is at:   http://zzo38computer.org/fossil/scirps.ui   You can clone with Fossil or view it in a web browser; select "Files" to view the files.
2020-12-13 09:27:25 <zzo38> If a table spans multiple pages, you can write "(Continued on next page)" at the bottom of each page, and repeat the table heading at the top of each page.
2020-12-13 09:28:06 <aaaaaa> zzo38: thanks!
2020-12-13 09:28:47 <shachaf> zzo38: You should enable TLS for your HTTP server, so that I can see it easily.
2020-12-13 09:29:44 <zzo38> Some uses of TeX that have cross references require you to run TeX multiple times, but that is actually unnecessary. While a non-immediate \write in a page will not work unless the page is shipped out, you can use insertions containing marks.
2020-12-13 09:31:09 <zzo38> shachaf: I did intend to enable TLS, and may do so later, but right now it isn't.
2020-12-13 09:31:35 <shachaf> i,i translation lookaside suffer
2020-12-13 09:33:06 <zzo38> I also wrote a style guide for SciRPS; if you like to review and know how to review such a thing, then you might do so to write a complaint of it.

2020-12-13 12:06:41 <int-e> Tinkerbell's Lip Service
2020-12-13 13:52:44 <fizzie> int-e: Right, there was something along those lines wrong with the web thing, but it's using a framework(tm), and I think I couldn't figure out why exactly it was behaving like that. It's Python/Flask, and the part that's my code *looks* like it should be just UTF-8 everywhere, but of course HTTP has its own thing about encoding negotiation, and none of that seemed to be exposed.
2020-12-13 13:53:40 <fizzie> Maybe I should just put a big bold warning up saying "please don't use this interface for files containing non-ASCII text". Or reimplement it.
2020-12-13 13:56:40 <fizzie> The "maintains a separate copy, needs manual sync with the repo" model is I think also a little hard to (a) explain (b) grok. Maybe there's something better.

2020-12-13 15:28:51 <fizzie> So more informally, it's a number >= 1 that measures how much harder part 2 was compared to part 1.
2020-12-13 15:30:59 <fizzie> I've also plotted https://zem.fi/tmp/aoc/time.one.html and https://zem.fi/tmp/aoc/time.two.html that just show the leaderboard times (with the thick bar showing the 25..75 range, and the thin rule showing the 1..100 range).
2020-12-13 15:31:42 <int-e> fizzie: the thing that troubled me most today was sign errors.
2020-12-13 15:31:59 <int-e> t = i (mod m) instead of t = -i (mod m)
2020-12-13 15:32:02 <int-e> twice.
2020-12-13 15:32:20 <fizzie> I did the "% isn't actually modulo" thing.
2020-12-13 15:33:13 <int-e> Oh I did not implement (or reuse) egcd.
2020-12-13 15:33:20 <fizzie> (In Go, as in C, it's the remainder from the truncated-towards-zero division.)
2020-12-13 15:34:21 <fizzie> I don't know if my solution is as elegant as it could be, but it runs in no appreciable amount of time, so it's fine. Just feel like it's missing a trick somewhere.
2020-12-13 15:34:22 <int-e> and I trusted the system to be solvable
2020-12-13 15:35:08 <fizzie> I do that as well.
2020-12-13 15:37:19 <int-e> http://paste.debian.net/1176718/ is the heart of my solution (with comments added right now)
2020-12-13 15:37:49 <int-e> Bezout meets KISS.
2020-12-13 15:38:51 <int-e> Oh and I flipped a sign; for the description to be correct the x + s should be x - s.

2020-12-13 15:39:30 <fizzie> I've got something quite similar except iterative, and I've replaced `lcm a b` with a*b, because all the initial numbers are prime, so all the pairs are coprime.
2020-12-13 15:40:16 User Name: LegionMammal978 = LegionMammal978!181e4e3e@c-24-30-78-62.hsd1.ga.comcast.net
2020-12-13 15:40:16 <LegionMammal978> I'm actually rather surprised that today scored so high on twistyness. I just recognized it as a Chinese Remainder problem and downloaded a preexisting library for it.
2020-12-13 15:40:18 <int-e> I didn't look at the input that closely
2020-12-13 15:40:23 <int-e> but it makes sense that the ids are prime
2020-12-13 15:40:35 <int-e> LegionMammal978: people don't know what that is
2020-12-13 15:40:48 <int-e> LegionMammal978: you could see yesterday that people struggle with basic linear algebra
2020-12-13 15:41:04 <fizzie> Go doesn't have a gcd/lcm built-in, so.
2020-12-13 15:41:25 <int-e> fizzie: sure I might look more closely at the list then and do the same
2020-12-13 15:42:56 <LegionMammal978> I will admit, though, that when I saw the second part of day 11 I just threw my hands up in defeat due to the silly CA neighborhood rules.
2020-12-13 15:44:52 <fizzie> Couldn't find a library to do that?-)
2020-12-13 15:45:14 <int-e> fizzie: the proper solution involves a modular inverse. When a and b are coprime, then r (mod a) and s (mod b) combine into r + a*(s-r)*(a^-1 (mod b)) (mod ab), noting that thanks to the multiplication by a, the (mod b) gets lifted to something (mod ab).
2020-12-13 15:45:49 <fizzie> It was a bit wonky, but so was the CA for 2019 day 24 part 2.
2020-12-13 15:46:11 <LegionMammal978> fizzie: In fact, I did use a library for the first part, but it ended up being very slow due to the library's poor documentation.
2020-12-13 15:46:36 <int-e> but since all ids were small the simple (though not quite naive) approach won the day
2020-12-13 15:47:05 <int-e> modular inverses can be computed using the extended euclidean algorithm, of course.
2020-12-13 15:47:32 <int-e> And indeed there must be libraries for this.
2020-12-13 15:50:07 <int-e> GP/PARI has this:  chinese(Mod(1,5), Mod(6,21)) = Mod(6, 105)
2020-12-13 15:50:18 <fizzie> int-e: Right, makes sense. I do in fact have a Go `func modinv(a, m int64) int64` in 2019 day 22 solutions.
2020-12-13 15:50:53 <fizzie> (And `func egcd(a, b int64) (g, x, y int64)` as well.)

2020-12-13 15:58:45 <nakilon> why not heat map
2020-12-13 15:59:00 <nakilon> would be one chart instead of 20
2020-12-13 16:03:24 <fizzie> Instead of 25.
2020-12-13 16:04:13 <fizzie> And I think it's easier to see values from a bar chart than judge shades in a heat map.
2020-12-13 16:05:02 <fizzie> Especially for the other one that shows four values per day.
2020-12-13 16:06:01 <nakilon> with 25 charts where values are grouped you are limited to compare years within a task number and can't easily compare tasks within a year
2020-12-13 16:06:27 <fizzie> Well, that's what I plotted it for, really.
2020-12-13 16:06:58 <nakilon> you would easily see both views in case of heat map
2020-12-13 16:07:34 <nakilon> color adds the third dimension
2020-12-13 16:08:34 <fizzie> Like I said, I think it's easier to read values from an axis than from a shade.
2020-12-13 16:09:03 <nakilon> in case of 25 charts there is tautology because you are already able to see which of 5 bars is 1st and which is 2nd, etc. and colors have no function so it's effectively black and white
2020-12-13 16:09:25 <fizzie> ...and not to repeat myself, but the other chart needs to show four values per day.
2020-12-13 16:09:37 <fizzie> Well, not "needs to", but "wants to".
2020-12-13 16:10:13 <fizzie> (Maybe that other chart should be one of those violin plots, though, those are so fancy.)

2020-12-13 19:11:55 <nakilon> b_jonas it will be with random read access to the stack instead of reading/writing to the program space
2020-12-13 19:12:23 <nakilon> I guess I'll need to clarify the "read" word everywhere, forgot about that
2020-12-13 19:12:42 <nakilon> and with Rational data type instead of byte or 32bit
2020-12-13 19:13:36 <nakilon> so you can put any number to the stack
2020-12-13 19:34:55 User Name: b_jonas = b_jonas!~x@catv-176-63-12-135.catv.broadband.hu
2020-12-13 19:34:55 <b_jonas> nakilon: I see. will you add random access from the bottom so that the coder doesn't have to count stack elements and adjust addresses? or some storage other than the stack, for even more convenience?
2020-12-13 19:51:06 <nakilon> bottom is kind of ephemeral in funge
2020-12-13 19:51:11 <nakilon> it's an eternal source of zeros
2020-12-13 19:51:57 <nakilon> in my opinion coder should not think there is a bottom
2020-12-13 19:53:27 <b_jonas> nakilon: ok, how about some other place of storage besides the stack then?
2020-12-13 19:53:30 <nakilon> specification is now done

2020-12-13 19:53:59 <nakilon> b_jonas I'll see if it's needed, I don't reject the idea of the second stack yet
2020-12-13 19:54:10 <nakilon> I'll see on practice if I feel that I need it
2020-12-13 19:54:24 <b_jonas> is the specification online? linked from https://esolangs.org/wiki/ or something?
2020-12-13 19:54:44 <nakilon> it's here https://github.com/Nakilon/rasel
2020-12-13 19:55:10 <nakilon> I'll move to wiki later in somewhat different form, with examples, etc.
2020-12-13 19:55:24 <b_jonas> ok
2020-12-13 19:55:25 <nakilon> *copy to wiki
2020-12-13 19:56:42 <b_jonas> "Lines with no non-space characters at the end of the source file are trimmed." => ooh, that will be a fun corner case when you try to jump over that line with a trampoline
2020-12-13 19:57:36 <b_jonas> "exit with code taken from the stack
2020-12-13 19:57:39 <b_jonas> If the value isn't integer and isn't within 0..255 the error is raised" => hmm....
2020-12-13 19:58:19 <b_jonas> I don't usually like silencing errors, but for exit converting the exit status silently is one of the few cases that I would support. not that it matters much since the program will exit either way.
2020-12-13 20:00:00 <b_jonas> nakilon: um, what kind of arithmetic exactly do the / and % operations do, if these are rational numbers?
2020-12-13 20:01:59 <b_jonas> nakilon: um, can this only do reads from deep in the stack, not writes?
2020-12-13 20:03:00 <b_jonas> I do understand that it's technically Turing-complete with just deep reads, but it's much harder to write programs for it that way, especially efficient practical ones
2020-12-13 20:04:02 <b_jonas> because you can't discard information from the stack, ever, if there's more than a few bits above it that you have to keep
2020-12-13 20:04:49 <b_jonas> or... maybe you can somehow with arbitrary precision integers. is there a way to swap the top two elements with these instructions, like with - or something?
2020-12-13 20:05:30 <b_jonas> there's a backslash instruction. so maybe you can encode a full stack to just the top element, but it's definitely not a practical way to write programs, it's more like the kind of torture that ais523 likes.

2020-12-13 20:12:49 <nakilon> thanks, I'll cover it here probably https://github.com/Nakilon/rasel/blob/3bbc664a04e8267e7a4780b0aff0bd483a0cf0ec/test.rb#L68
2020-12-13 20:14:58 <nakilon> b_jonas the trouble will be for those who got used to Befunge if they don't push 0 before exit and if they care about the exit code
2020-12-13 20:15:38 <nakilon> but if they don't care it's just an exit code, no "error message" or "backtrace" is designed
2020-12-13 20:15:57 <nakilon> nor  it is for Befunge I guess
2020-12-13 20:17:03 <nakilon> the / % arithmetics are like in Ruby
2020-12-13 20:17:06 <nakilon> irb(main):001:0> 2r / 3
2020-12-13 20:17:06 <nakilon> => (2/3)
2020-12-13 20:17:06 <nakilon> irb(main):002:0> 2r / 3 * 6
2020-12-13 20:17:06 <nakilon> => (4/1)
2020-12-13 20:17:33 <nakilon> irb(main):003:0> 2r/3 + 4r/5
2020-12-13 20:17:34 <nakilon> => (22/15)
2020-12-13 20:18:42 <nakilon> in case of Befunge with the integer math by default the division for negative numbers had to clarify in which side to round
2020-12-13 20:18:53 <nakilon> in case of Rational there is no rounding, nothing to worry about
2020-12-13 20:22:53 <nakilon> b_jonas I guess I understood your point, the inability to push deeper of from the other side may suck
2020-12-13 20:23:12 <nakilon> I'm thinking now about positional swap, lol
2020-12-13 20:23:27 <nakilon> "swap top value with Nth"
2020-12-13 20:24:32 <nakilon> either something like that or at least defining the bottom of the stack and push to the bottom
2020-12-13 20:37:17 <b_jonas> nakilon: what does % do then? or how do you compute the floor of a number?
2020-12-13 20:37:37 <b_jonas> no wait, make that easier. how do you compute the floor of a positive number?
2020-12-13 20:40:04 <nakilon> actually I guess the trimming corner case was already covered in '"' test but I'll make there too to be sure
2020-12-13 20:41:40 <nakilon> irb(main):001:0> (5r/3) % 1
2020-12-13 20:41:40 <nakilon> => (2/3)
2020-12-13 20:41:40 <nakilon> you mean this?
2020-12-13 20:43:06 <nakilon> $ echo "53/1%.@" | ./bin/rasel
2020-12-13 20:43:07 <nakilon> 0.6666666666666666
2020-12-13 20:44:09 <nakilon> n$ echo "83/:1%-.@" | ./bin/rasel
2020-12-13 20:44:09 <nakilon> 2
2020-12-13 20:47:06 <b_jonas> ok, so the % computes one of the many remainder or modulus operations, and you can use that to compute the floor. good.
2020-12-13 20:47:12 <b_jonas> then at least the arithmetic works
2020-12-13 20:47:21 <nakilon> ..D
