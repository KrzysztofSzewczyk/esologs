2020-12-13 00:49:23 <fizzie> Did days 1-9 of 2018 to get a little bit more context. Honestly they're not that dissimilar from this year, so I'm thinking 2019 was just very #esoteric-audience-appropriate year.
2020-12-13 01:01:00 <nakilon> I could not continue 2019 in Befunge https://github.com/Nakilon/adventofcode-befunge
2020-12-13 01:01:19 <nakilon> because the next task demanded dances with 'g' and 'p'
2020-12-13 01:02:15 <nakilon> that's why I finally started making my language and I'll continue solving 2019 in it
2020-12-13 01:02:58 <fizzie> I think we discussed how all those people who do the "every day a new language" challenge might've been a bit miffed about the whole Intcode thing.

2020-12-13 06:59:24 <shachaf> It was a dead end anyway.

2020-12-13 07:20:38 <shachaf> Got it.
2020-12-13 07:20:53 <shachaf> I was wondering whether that island was solvable on its own.

2020-12-13 07:37:29 <int-e> I haven't touched the game much either though. 513 islands now (+1 from last report)... that one had a friend though, remarkably.
2020-12-13 07:37:56 <int-e> Which I hadn't seen before. So there are at least 10 friends to find.

2020-12-13 07:46:05 <shachaf> I think I'm at 192 or so.
2020-12-13 07:46:09 <shachaf> 197
2020-12-13 07:46:45 <shachaf> 513 sounds like way too many.
2020-12-13 07:49:50 <int-e> I think you'll need 300 or 350 to reach the end
2020-12-13 07:50:07 <int-e> but there's a lot of area to the sides
2020-12-13 07:51:02 <int-e> And it's worth reaching the end first... it lifts the global fog so you can assess the area where islands are
2020-12-13 07:51:26 <int-e> I hope that isn't a huge spoiler.
2020-12-13 07:52:11 <shachaf> You've mentioned it already, anyway.
2020-12-13 07:52:44 <int-e> (To my mind the fog is mainly fluff for flavor and guidance (see where you've been), not an essential part of the puzzles.)
2020-12-13 07:53:56 <shachaf> I think "there's more to do there" was more arguably a spoiler.
2020-12-13 07:54:05 <shachaf> Though I was just thinking along those lines myself anyway, seeing the footprints.
2020-12-13 07:54:21 <int-e> Yeah I thought of that as a spoiler.
2020-12-13 07:54:40 <int-e> Not a tremendously big one, but still.
2020-12-13 07:57:25 <shachaf> Hmm, I like the puzzle at 264,237

2020-12-13 08:07:49 <int-e> I forgot already

2020-12-13 08:13:12 <zzo38> Probably, the level compression of Free Hero Mesh should be improved. It is better than Hero Mesh (which doesn't compress and also is inefficient in its coding in other ways), but perhaps improvement could be made. I tried a few things that didn't work. (Maybe, if I try again 100 times then maybe it will eventually work, I don't know.)
2020-12-13 08:13:52 <shachaf> The series I was talking about seems to have the theme "push off of a non-rock".
2020-12-13 08:14:15 <int-e> zzo38: how many GB of data are you talking about
2020-12-13 08:14:45 <int-e> shachaf: ah, littering
2020-12-13 08:15:12 <zzo38> int-e: Less than one.
2020-12-13 08:15:39 <int-e> zzo38: so maybe it's not worth improving the compression for
2020-12-13 08:16:12 <zzo38> (But if a collection of many puzzle sets is made later, then there will be more.)
2020-12-13 08:16:47 <int-e> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren't_gonna_need_it
2020-12-13 08:17:56 <zzo38> int-e: Perhaps you are correct. Perhaps it can even be simplified from what it is now (although it can still be made more efficient than the EKS format, which uses 16-bit fields even though only 8-bits are needed).
2020-12-13 08:18:04 <shachaf> OK, enough for today.
2020-12-13 08:18:08 <shachaf> I'm at 224 islands.

2020-12-13 08:19:21 <shachaf> But I'll just watch the videos instead.

2020-12-13 08:24:52 <shachaf> The main problem is that the talks themselves are recorded, and I don't want my voice in them.
2020-12-13 08:25:11 <shachaf> I did type a few questions that the speaker answered, before.
2020-12-13 08:25:25 <shachaf> Did I mention the surprising fact the speaker said?
2020-12-13 08:25:54 <shachaf> The fact is: For UNSAT instances, you should restart very frequently, and for SAT instances, you should restart infrequently.
2020-12-13 08:26:04 <shachaf> If you'd asked me to guess, I would've predicted the exact opposite.
2020-12-13 08:27:14 <int-e> hmm, yeah that feels counterintuitive.
2020-12-13 08:28:03 <zzo38> I will still need to fix the level compression anyways, since in one converted level, it results three Field objects at (7,1) even though there is supposed to be only two (although all but one is redundant anyways, but that is what it is in the original; it isn't my fault!)
2020-12-13 08:29:43 <int-e> I can rationalize the former a bit, I guess: maybe for UNSAT the idea is that when you take a fresh look at the problem you gain insights (learn clauses) that are unrelated to what you did before... and hence maybe more useful
2020-12-13 08:30:24 <int-e> rathet than comprehensively exploring a corner of the problem based on the first couple of choices you made.
2020-12-13 08:30:34 <int-e> *rather
2020-12-13 08:31:12 <int-e> And SAT might actually need a distinction between problems with few models and problems with plenty of them.
2020-12-13 08:33:48 <zzo38> What does UNSAT mean?
2020-12-13 08:34:34 <int-e> unsatisfactory... sorry, kidding. unsatisfiable
2020-12-13 08:35:13 <shachaf> int-e: My original intuition for restarting was, maybe you get stuck in some difficult and fruitless subtree for a long time, and if you'd just started with a slightly different guess you'd've found a solution immediately.
2020-12-13 08:35:25 <shachaf> But that seems more applicable to SAT than to UNSAT.
2020-12-13 08:35:37 <int-e> SAT and UNSAT are names for the yes and no answer of a (here: propositional) satisfiability problem.
2020-12-13 08:35:44 <shachaf> Yes.
2020-12-13 08:36:00 <shachaf> I mean, if there is a solution, it seems like maybe you can jump around and hope to find it.
2020-12-13 08:36:11 <shachaf> But if there isn't one then it seems like you'd need to be more exhaustive.
2020-12-13 08:36:15 <int-e> shachaf: Right, but one of the lessons here, I think, is that you really have to think in terms of learning.
2020-12-13 08:36:16 <zzo38> O, OK.
2020-12-13 08:36:19 <shachaf> Certainly for regular DPLL it seems like that's how it'd work.
2020-12-13 08:36:32 <shachaf> Right, I was about to say. It must be about clause learning things that I don't have a good feel for here.
2020-12-13 08:37:03 <shachaf> I meant "more applicable to SAT instances than to UNSAT instances".
2020-12-13 08:37:17 <int-e> Yeah I've been there :)
2020-12-13 08:38:16 <int-e> As you probably know there are randomized solvers that are only good for SAT instances... random walks are kind of continuous restarts
2020-12-13 08:39:03 <int-e> I don't know whether they're still better than CDCL solvers for SAT instances. They used to be.
2020-12-13 08:41:57 User Name: aaaaaa = aaaaaa!~ArthurStr@188.163.100.177
2020-12-13 08:41:57 <aaaaaa> int-e: WalkSAT. But only good for underconstrained problems. I.e., that can have many solutions. AFAIR!
2020-12-13 08:42:16 <aaaaaa> Like $n$ queens
2020-12-13 08:44:29 <shachaf> Randomized solvers as in local search?
2020-12-13 08:45:29 <shachaf> https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4413 makes the argument that CDCL solvers with very frequent restarts are very similar to local search.
2020-12-13 08:50:46 <int-e> That resonates... I may have seen or heard that idea before somewhere.
2020-12-13 08:51:09 <int-e> Can't place it though.
