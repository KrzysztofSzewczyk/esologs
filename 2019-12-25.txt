2019-12-25 02:16:15 <int-e> fungot: can you obfuscate boolean circuits?
2019-12-25 02:16:15 <fungot> int-e: python lets you assign things to variables.
2019-12-25 02:17:43 <int-e> that's... almost relevant
2019-12-25 02:20:17 <fizzie> fungot: Can you simulate B12/S1V?
2019-12-25 02:20:17 <fungot> fizzie: it was before i went to the party. the party. so you reported what he said... never mind. it needs an fnord.
2019-12-25 02:20:29 <fizzie> That's less so.
2019-12-25 02:23:20 <int-e> Is that an AoC question?
2019-12-25 02:23:41 <int-e> Oh, yes it is.
2019-12-25 02:24:11 <int-e> I may have seen that notation before.
2019-12-25 02:24:38 <int-e> Maybe minus the letters, just 3/23 for GoL?
2019-12-25 02:26:31 <int-e> fizzie: I made the mistake of including diagonal neighbours... twice.
2019-12-25 02:26:51 <fizzie> I think I had seen B23/S3 for GoL.
2019-12-25 02:27:18 <fizzie> The V suffix I hadn't seen anywhere, picked it up from https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Rulestring for my notes though.
2019-12-25 02:27:27 <int-e> (Because I had to rewrite everything for part 2. The one bit I copied over turned out to be flawed :) )
2019-12-25 02:28:41 <int-e> Because for part 1, I included the cell itself in the "neighbour" count. So the formula for the final cell didn't work anymore in part 2...
2019-12-25 02:28:52 <int-e> "formula"
2019-12-25 02:29:06 <fizzie> I think I managed to make about every single trivial mistake I could possibly have made when writing up part 1.
2019-12-25 02:29:20 <fizzie> Maybe because I had just woken up.
2019-12-25 02:29:46 <int-e> "This is easy... I'll just breeze through... why doesn't this work?"
2019-12-25 02:29:50 <fizzie> Shifting to the wrong direction (in at least three separate occasions), using `i` where `1 << i` was intended, using the wrong variables.
2019-12-25 02:29:59 <fizzie> Yes, that's almost exactly what I was thinking.
2019-12-25 02:30:12 <fizzie> "I'll just fix this and then we can have breakfast, won't take long."
2019-12-25 02:30:19 <int-e> Oh I got the final count correct at least :)
2019-12-25 02:30:50 <int-e> But it was less frustrating then the day before (did you see my privmsg?)
2019-12-25 02:31:25 <fizzie> Oh, right, I forgot to have a look at that. But yeah, kind of thought it might be.
2019-12-25 02:31:59 <int-e> (Which, btw, is all my fault for sticking to an inconvenient interpreter design. Purity is not really the problem, I could have an interpreter that returns continuations for input and output actions.)
2019-12-25 02:33:03 <fizzie> Only one more. Although over on Go side, I've only done 1-6, 11, 18, 19, 22. Kind of want to do the complete set for some reason.
2019-12-25 02:33:21 <int-e> Rather than having a [Reply] -> [Request] type, it would be  data M = M Request (Reply -> M)
2019-12-25 02:33:47 <int-e> And I could collect requests, compute the replies, and feed them to the continuation at my leisure.
2019-12-25 02:34:19 <int-e> And I should've done that for the labyrinth task.
2019-12-25 02:36:37 <fizzie> I think several of them have had labyrinths. The one with the keys, and the one with the donuts.
2019-12-25 02:38:03 <int-e> It's the one you missed, the oxygen one.
2019-12-25 02:38:29 <int-e> The one where you actually had to do some exploration of the labyrinth.
2019-12-25 02:38:47 <int-e> Day 15.
2019-12-25 02:39:38 <int-e> Oh https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Rulestring actually mentioned the variant without letters, but it has survival first: 23/3 for GoL.
2019-12-25 02:40:58 <int-e> "has fallen into disuse in recent years"
2019-12-25 02:41:04 <fizzie> Oh, right, the one I did super-slow.
2019-12-25 02:41:47 <fizzie> AIUI, the Bx/Sy variant is what Golly uses.
2019-12-25 02:42:15 <int-e> (TBF, the "in recent years" was written in 2017, so maybe it's still okay)
2019-12-25 02:43:22 <int-e> fizzie: I was briefly tempted to stop after day 21 actually, to keep the 42 stars :)
2019-12-25 02:45:14 <int-e> Day 22 is shaping up to have the most difficult part 2 (relative to part 1)...
2019-12-25 02:46:07 <int-e> I guess programmers don't need to know linear algebra.
2019-12-25 02:46:11 <fizzie> By a wide margin, if the stats table is a good metric of that.
2019-12-25 02:46:22 Joined: Lord_of_Life
2019-12-25 02:47:32 <int-e> But day 16 is holding up pretty well too.
2019-12-25 02:48:01 <fizzie> It might just be because part 1 is so eminently solvable without any cleverness, just by following the instructions. In fact, my part 1 solution actually did the motions on the whole deck, instead of just the card it asks about.
2019-12-25 02:48:46 <fizzie> For 16 I think it's kind of a what do you call them, a trick question.
2019-12-25 02:49:10 <int-e> I think so, yes.

2019-12-25 02:50:22 <int-e> It's too bad that the absolute numbers are pretty much meaningless.
2019-12-25 02:50:42 <int-e> (though we can see a nice decay from day 1 to now)
2019-12-25 02:51:08 <int-e> And, oh, the graph display is flawed.
2019-12-25 02:51:19 <int-e> It should carry the remainder from the gold stars into the silver stars.
2019-12-25 02:51:48 <int-e> (The bar on day 22 shouldn't be shorter than the ones above and below.)
2019-12-25 02:53:24 <fizzie> Some of the top 100 scores are pretty impressive. For 3590, you'd have to average... about 75 points/star.
2019-12-25 02:54:01 <int-e> > 3590/48
2019-12-25 02:54:03 <lambdabot> 74.79166666666667

2019-12-25 02:54:41 <lambdabot> 9.706666666666667
2019-12-25 02:55:42 <int-e> I agree, being consistently fast on these tasks is impressive.
2019-12-25 02:56:12 <fizzie> I have a few friends working at one of the sponsors (Reaktor -- kind of a given, they're pretty big employer of software engineers in Finland), though haven't seen them on the lists.
2019-12-25 02:58:08 <int-e> Of course you have to approach this differently if you aim for the lists. Have a template ready (odd days: Intcode interpreter, parser, maybe even an invocation of the interpreter), and a command to fetch the input at the right time. May easily shave of 2-3 minutes from the solving time, which seems to be crucial.
2019-12-25 02:58:31 <int-e> shave *off

2019-12-25 03:06:19 <int-e> Yeah my lack of attention is deplorable.

2019-12-25 03:15:40 <oerjan> of course if they're any smart they're already suspicious after the first one.
2019-12-25 03:16:35 <int-e> I'd be disappointed if they weren't smart.

2019-12-25 03:19:06 <oerjan> this spelling thing is clearly not following normal causality tdnh
2019-12-25 03:19:13 <int-e> Well, I just checked... we had not seen Schlock for (just shy) over 4 weeks.
2019-12-25 03:20:03 <int-e> There are way too many story threads. Except, somehow, each of them is entertaining in and of itself (to me).
2019-12-25 03:20:26 <oerjan> there's some heavy splitting of the party going on
2019-12-25 03:20:44 <int-e> Oh right. Poor DM.
2019-12-25 03:23:06 <oerjan> now with lota out of commission they can't use their original plan for getting the rest of the teams into that pa'anuri warship
2019-12-25 03:24:01 <oerjan> then again maybe petey built a copy. he did say he would.
2019-12-25 03:24:11 <int-e> oerjan: Did you notice that LOTA was addressed with puny pronouns and did not object?
