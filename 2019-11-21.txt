2019-11-21 00:02:26 <fizzie> Weird. I've been refactoring umlbox code a little (in preparation for some tweaks), and one thing I changed was to start using "con1=fd:N,fd:M", where N is /dev/null (opened RDWR) and M is the inherited stdout (for capturing the command output).
2019-11-21 00:02:53 <fizzie> Previously it was "con1=null,fd:M", which uses UML's 'null' console type instead, which makes reads block forever.
2019-11-21 00:03:08 <fizzie> Locally this seemed to make commands like "cat" reliably return quickly, instead of waiting for the timeout. But on the bot machine, it's... flaky. Now it's again returning quickly, but earlier I wasn't, even though I changed nothing.

2019-11-21 01:50:31 <fizzie> There's a wonky thing umlbox does which is to append a ' | cat' to the command line if the stdout of the call isn't a terminal. I assume that's because from the UML command's perspective /dev/tty1 is always a TTY, even when UML has connected it to a pipe/file.

2019-11-21 01:59:05 <fizzie> Oh, that's right, that's one reason why stdout and stderr ordering was pretty wonky even before: the '| cat' thing only deals with stdout, stderr goes directly to /dev/tty1.
2019-11-21 01:59:33 <fizzie> That said, I'm not sure what I managed to break there.

2019-11-21 02:04:24 <fizzie> I also got two different outputs for the same command before, so there's a race condition somewhere as well.

2019-11-21 02:07:41 <fizzie> What the hackbot side does is, `p = subprocess.Popen(args, stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, close_fds=True); p.stdin.close(); ret = p.stdout.read(1024)`. No matter how the UML process outputs things, they should all still end up in the same pipe.
2019-11-21 02:09:33 <shachaf> int-e: Hmm, is something like "non-chronological backjumping" actually mandatory when doing clause learning?
2019-11-21 02:09:54 <shachaf> I thought it would be optional but you want to have a reason for every assignment, and if you do regular backtracking, do you even have a reason?

2019-11-21 02:15:07 <fizzie> Yeah, IDGI. Running the umlbox command line for 'echo foo; echo bar; echo baz' and 'echo foo >&2; echo bar >&2; echo baz >&2' manually on the same system, with 1>/tmp/out.1 2>/tmp/out.2, there's no difference: both write exactly the same content into.... ohhh, I get it.
2019-11-21 02:16:03 <fizzie> The bot does a .read() on the stdout pipe. When you're writing to stderr, it probably gets split to multiple writes, which means it only receives the first line.
2019-11-21 02:16:32 <fizzie> But when you write to stdout, it's a fully buffered stream (through the | cat), so it gets the full chunk in one .read().
2019-11-21 02:17:13 <oerjan> fiendish
2019-11-21 02:20:11 <fizzie> I think I can just wrap it in a io.BufferedReader to fix it. Although I still don't know how it actually broke.
2019-11-21 02:23:49 <shachaf> int-e: Wait, maybe I'm just wrong and you can use the conflicting clause.
2019-11-21 02:28:59 <fizzie> Hmm, well, it wasn't that simple. It's true that the .read() call only returns the first line, but then a subsequent .read() actually says it's at EOF. How does that make sense? It doesn't make sense.
2019-11-21 02:30:02 <fizzie> Maybe it could be non-blocking somehow... although I don't think so.
2019-11-21 02:35:02 <fizzie> No, it's not that. If I make umlbox write a line to the file descriptor used before closing it, the bot does read that.
2019-11-21 02:35:25 <fizzie> So it's just that somehow the uml terminates before it has written all the output.
2019-11-21 02:40:35 <fizzie> Super weird. It also happens outside the bot, if I direct the output to a pipe. Immediately after the first line has been written, it terminates. With no messages.
2019-11-21 02:52:44 <oerjan> did this change happen when you upgraded debian, or is there something you actually edited involved?
2019-11-21 02:53:25 <oerjan> fizzie: ^
2019-11-21 02:53:45 <oerjan> because the latter should at least be bisectable...
2019-11-21 02:54:05 <fizzie> Hard to say. People don't usually write to stderr that much. But I can always roll back to an old version and test again.
2019-11-21 02:54:24 <fizzie> Right now I'm getting really bizarre behavior out.
2019-11-21 02:55:12 <oerjan> just change that | cat to |& cat  and call it a day :)
2019-11-21 02:56:03 <shachaf> int-e: Wait, now I'm on the train and it doesn't make sense again.
2019-11-21 02:56:04 <fizzie> It runs using /bin/sh, it doesn't work there. But I did give that a think.
2019-11-21 02:56:16 <fizzie> 2>&1 | cat might work.
2019-11-21 02:57:21 <oerjan> shachaf: that reminds me of something.  oh right, the "i'm on a horse" meme.
2019-11-21 02:57:37 <fizzie> Anyway, the output behaviour is really bizarre. I'm adding printfs here in umlbox init, and only some of them get out, even when I'm not really doing anything special. As soon as it starts to read from the /ubda device, everything goes weird.
2019-11-21 02:58:18 <fizzie> I seem to consistently get all the output from the printfs before the first read, whatever that means.
2019-11-21 02:59:17 <fizzie> Well, except sometimes I don't get even that.
2019-11-21 02:59:26 <shachaf> oerjan: Is that like "I've been through the desert on a horse with no name"?
2019-11-21 03:01:19 <fizzie> I think there might just be some sort of a thing where UML has no way to say "flush everything that has been written to the console/serial channels before terminating" when init calls `sync(); reboot(LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_POWER_OFF);` on it.

2019-11-21 03:07:52 <fizzie> FWIW, doing '2>&1 | cat' didn't actually fix it. And anyway it's not strictly related to stderr. Here's the behavior I'm consistently getting when doing something close to what the bot is doing: http://ix.io/22oJ
2019-11-21 03:07:56 <fizzie> Does that make any sense?
2019-11-21 03:08:55 <fizzie> (No.)
2019-11-21 03:10:38 <fizzie> Bah. Maybe I'll try the Debian standard 4.19 UML kernel, instead of my home-built 4.9 one. Although I think there must've been some reason why I built my own.
2019-11-21 03:12:01 <shachaf> fizzie: I haven't been reading the whole log. What's with only the first line being printed? Is that the nonsensical thing?
2019-11-21 03:12:27 <fizzie> Well, occasionally it's weirder than that, but yes.
2019-11-21 03:12:40 <shachaf> When is it weirder?
2019-11-21 03:13:06 <fizzie> I don't think I can describe this.
2019-11-21 03:13:10 <shachaf> Is this echo the builtin or /bin/echo? Can you strace it?
2019-11-21 03:13:20 <shachaf> I'm typing on my phone so everything is scow.
2019-11-21 03:13:43 <fizzie> I can't strace UML. I could probably strace inside it, but I'm not sure how much that would help.
2019-11-21 03:13:53 <fizzie> Anyway, I switched to the new UML kernel and now it outputs nothing at all.
2019-11-21 03:13:58 <fizzie> `echo ping
2019-11-21 03:14:00 <HackEso> No output.
2019-11-21 03:14:02 <fizzie> Not great.
2019-11-21 03:14:31 <shachaf> What if you strace inside it? Is it one write call or three?
2019-11-21 03:14:52 <fizzie> Well, I can't, now.
2019-11-21 03:15:29 <fizzie> It just crashes with: Trying to reregister IRQ 2 FD 4 TYPE 0 ID (____ptrval____) \ open(rfile, O_RDONLY): Device or resource busy
2019-11-21 03:18:00 <fizzie> (This is when it's trying to open the tty1 device.)
2019-11-21 03:19:20 <fizzie> Bah, I'll revert back to my own 4.9 version and give up for now. At least it works to some degree. It's not even impossible it's been broken a little like that for long now.
2019-11-21 03:21:06 <fizzie> By the way, it was with the echo builtin; with /bin/echo both the plain and | cat version print all lines.
2019-11-21 03:22:31 <fizzie> Doing strace inside suggests the plain version is three separate writes, with | cat... well, I don't get the strace output, so it's kind of hard to say.
2019-11-21 03:23:05 <shachaf> You can't strace into a file?
2019-11-21 03:23:16 <fizzie> And with /bin/echo I get more of the strace output, but not all of it.
2019-11-21 03:23:28 <shachaf> Is that bash -c /bin/echo or/bin/echo directly?
2019-11-21 03:23:29 <fizzie> I guess I could, I would just need to hostfs mount something in writable form.
2019-11-21 03:24:02 <fizzie> bash -c /bin/echo.
2019-11-21 03:24:32 <shachaf> Maybe your computer's haunted?
2019-11-21 03:26:10 <fizzie> Okay: with bash -c 'echo -e ...', no cat, I get the full output and it got written as three separate writes.
2019-11-21 03:27:12 * oerjan suddenly thinks of the non-inheritable fds mentioned yesterday
2019-11-21 03:27:26 <fizzie> With bash -c 'echo -e ...' and the cat -- and note that this cat is outside the UML kernel, it's just changing the UML's stdout from a (pseudo)terminal to a pipe -- I only get the first line of output, and it was attempted to be written as three separate writes, but the third failed with EPIPE.
2019-11-21 03:27:27 <oerjan> could that be involved?
2019-11-21 03:28:46 <shachaf> What is cat seeing? I guess read 5 and then read 0?
2019-11-21 03:28:55 <shachaf> EPIPE is odd.
2019-11-21 03:29:13 <fizzie> With bash -c /bin/echo, I sometimes get no output at all, and a single write of the whole 15 bytes which fails with EIO.
2019-11-21 03:29:39 <fizzie> And occasionally I get the full output, and three separate writes of 5 bytes each.
2019-11-21 03:29:49 <shachaf> OK, I'm spooked.
2019-11-21 03:30:06 <fizzie> And the last combination, /bin/echo with cat, seems to consistently produce all three lines of output.
2019-11-21 03:30:17 <fizzie> Written in a single 15-byte write.
2019-11-21 03:30:49 <fizzie> I don't think I've even seen EIO before.
2019-11-21 03:30:54 <shachaf> What's closing the pipe?
2019-11-21 03:31:16 <oerjan> (gremlins)
2019-11-21 03:32:34 <fizzie> The umlbox wrapper script does close the file descriptor, but that's supposedly the write end of the pipe, and anyway should only happen after the UML kernel process has terminated and been wait'd for.
2019-11-21 03:32:41 <fizzie> Let me strace that cat on the outside too.

2019-11-21 03:34:58 <fizzie> Okay, built-in echo with cat. Saw one line of output. Inside, bash did three write calls of 5 bytes each; first two returned 5, the last returned -1 EPIPE. Outside, the cat did one read(0, "foo1\n", 131072) and got 5 bytes, then the next read returned 0/EOF.
2019-11-21 03:36:04 <fizzie> I've no idea what could be closing the pipe. The only people who should even have access to the read end of the pipe would be cat (which doesn't seem to be closing it) and bash (which I assume wouldn't do it without a good reason).
2019-11-21 03:36:30 <fizzie> The umlbox wrapper script, and the UML kernel, should only have a file descriptor for the write end.

2019-11-21 06:25:56 <int-e> shachaf: AFAIUI the connection is that the backjump clause used for backjumping is a promising clause to learn (a nontrivial consequence of the existing clauses). But you don't have to use it for backjumping.
2019-11-21 06:27:10 <int-e> shachaf: Actually, nontrivial and at least marginally useful... it would have detected the conflict at hand one or more decisions earlier.

2019-11-21 08:00:57 <int-e> shachaf: Hmm, actually there is a far simpler way to get /some/ learnable clause: Collect the negation of all decision literals on the trail. Presumably it's not very effective (for that clause to be applicable, you need to have all but one of those literals on the trail again, though possibly in a different order. With pure backtracking (no backumping, no restarts) that will never happen!)
2019-11-21 08:03:03 <int-e> So one way of viewing the backjump clause is as a way of identifying relevant literals for the current conflict.
2019-11-21 08:09:14 <int-e> . o O ( Hmm. Fun though incorrect attempt of framing this: CDCL solvers are SAT modulo unit propagation solvers, and backjump are unsatisfiable cores. )

2019-11-21 08:30:17 <b_jonas> so HackEso has grown mysterious bugs?
2019-11-21 08:33:30 <shachaf> int-e: So the first time my friend I were trying to figure out CDCL, we just started writing code, starting with a really simple DPLL solver and demorganizing the trail to learn clauses.
2019-11-21 08:34:10 <shachaf> It was only when we saw that it changed literally nothing about the behavior of the solver that we thought about it for a few seconds and realized it was ridiculous.
2019-11-21 08:36:04 <int-e> heh it probably made it slower ;)
2019-11-21 08:36:48 <shachaf> I mean, it was written in Python.
2019-11-21 08:36:50 <int-e> Maybe I should implement a SAT solver. But to what end...
2019-11-21 08:36:53 <shachaf> So it was already maximally slow.
2019-11-21 08:37:18 <shachaf> int-e: Anyway, when you do something like FirstUIP, you need a "reason" for each assignment (other than decisions).
2019-11-21 08:37:57 <shachaf> If you do the typical backtracking thing (invert the last decision and mark it as a forced literal), you don't have a clause to point to as the reason for the new assignment. Do you?
2019-11-21 08:39:39 <int-e> True, you'd have to derive the corresponding backjump clause (LastUIP)
2019-11-21 08:40:23 <shachaf> Oh, you can keep resolving on units from this level until your clause includes the decision literal, you mean.
2019-11-21 08:40:47 <int-e> yeah, since that's how backjumping simulates backtracking
2019-11-21 08:41:26 <shachaf> Right. I guess I can do that.
2019-11-21 08:41:54 <shachaf> I implemented CDCL and FirstUIP on the flight (no clause deletion, just allocating enough memory for all the learned clauses).
2019-11-21 08:42:27 <shachaf> It made the number of decisions and units go way down, but the solver also takes much much longer.
2019-11-21 08:42:52 <shachaf> Which seems like a great tradeoff, since I hate making decisions.
2019-11-21 08:44:03 <int-e> Yeah deleting clauses is very important for performance. Which is awful because it's another open-ended playing field for heuristics.

2019-11-21 08:49:00 <int-e> shachaf: Hmm, many reasons, from growing 2WL lists to worse locality of memory access. And a lot of clauses turn out to be useless (for example, because they are subsumed by other clauses, or because while they do contribute to conflicts, those are exceedingly rare).
2019-11-21 08:50:25 <shachaf> Right, one thing I ws thinking was that before doing CDCL I almost don't have to wory about cache locality, but once I have an unbnded number of clauses I have to worry a lot.
2019-11-21 08:50:31 <int-e> The average 2WL list grows linearly with the number of clauses.
2019-11-21 08:51:56 <int-e> (Very naive estimate: 2 times number of clauses divided by number of literals. It's probably better in practice because clauses can end up on watch lists of literals that are never considered.)

2019-11-21 08:52:21 * int-e shrugs
2019-11-21 08:52:42 <int-e> That "probably" is a fairly wild guess. I have no data.
2019-11-21 08:52:51 <shachaf> Ideally watches move to and stay on literals you don't assign as much.
2019-11-21 08:53:11 <shachaf> Or whose negation you don't assign as much, anyway.
2019-11-21 08:53:43 <int-e> The way I think of it, I'd put A v B on the watch lists for ~A and ~B.
2019-11-21 08:54:24 <shachaf> I mean, where you put the negation doesn't matter.
2019-11-21 08:54:31 <int-e> But I don't know what's standard here...
2019-11-21 08:54:32 <int-e> Yeah.
2019-11-21 08:54:50 <int-e> I understood what you said.
2019-11-21 08:55:02 <int-e> Or wrote. Whatever.
2019-11-21 08:55:40 <shachaf> Clause collection seems hard.
2019-11-21 08:55:52 <shachaf> By which I mean you have to make a lot of decisions.
2019-11-21 08:58:08 <int-e> Yeah I'm afraid this is where you read another half dozen papers.
2019-11-21 09:00:02 <int-e> There are some obvious statistics like length of clause, how often clauses are used in unit propagation (possibly per level though that'd be a serious amount of memory, so hard to justify. maybe if you assign weights to the levels?)...
2019-11-21 09:00:13 <shachaf> OK, some of these learned clauses are pretty bad, now that I look at them.
2019-11-21 09:00:58 <shachaf> One of the is a unit!
2019-11-21 09:01:22 <shachaf> Man, when you learn a unit, I bet you can just delete all the relevant clauses etc. out of your database when you restart.
2019-11-21 09:01:32 <int-e> Okay, if you learn a unit clause you have a clear way of pruning the clauses :)
2019-11-21 09:01:50 <shachaf> It's kind of an odd property of CDCL that you can't do that in general.
2019-11-21 09:01:57 <shachaf> (When normally you think of DPLL as solving subproblems.)
2019-11-21 09:02:30 <int-e> You can check for clause subsumption... just not efficiently ;)
2019-11-21 09:02:41 <int-e> (Maybe I'm not imaginative enough.)
2019-11-21 09:03:27 <int-e> Even if you learn a unit clause it's not entirely clear how to deal with that efficiently.
2019-11-21 09:03:57 <shachaf> Why?
2019-11-21 09:04:00 <int-e> (If you want to avoid scanning *all* clauses. Maybe just go through that literal's watch lists?)
2019-11-21 09:04:14 <int-e> (But then you have to do that periodically.)
2019-11-21 09:04:15 <shachaf> Oh, I was thinking to just go through the watch list.
2019-11-21 09:04:33 <shachaf> But also scanning all clauses up to num_vars times doesn't seem that bad.
2019-11-21 09:04:48 <shachaf> Maybe the clause database gets really big, or real-world SAT problems have a large number of variables.
2019-11-21 09:05:14 <int-e> I'm sure both of these happen.
2019-11-21 09:06:01 <shachaf> But you can probably do it opportunistically reasonably well.
2019-11-21 09:06:15 <shachaf> I mean, if you're learning a lot of units, you're doing pretty well, I'd hope.
2019-11-21 09:07:03 <int-e> Anyway, all these decisions is why I don't really want to write a SAT solver. (I have no expectation of improving the state of the art, and I wouldn't expect to learn all that much either...)
2019-11-21 09:30:59 <shachaf> Does it make sense to resolve on the same variable twice while doing LastUIP?
2019-11-21 09:31:11 <shachaf> I should get some paper and figure out what's going on with my life.
2019-11-21 09:32:11 <int-e> shachaf: not really? I mean the resolved variable is on the trail, which should not have any duplicates?
2019-11-21 09:33:04 <shachaf> Oh, that's not what's going on.
2019-11-21 09:33:23 <shachaf> What's going on is that I want to add a variable to the trail from one that was previously resolved on from another clause?
2019-11-21 09:33:29 <shachaf> Hmm.
2019-11-21 09:34:06 <int-e> Oh. That may happen.
2019-11-21 09:34:34 <shachaf> But then I don't want to resolve on it again. So the second time I should add it to the non-resolvable pool?
2019-11-21 09:34:46 <int-e> Are you sure you don't want to do that?
2019-11-21 09:34:51 <shachaf> I feel like I'm making this too complicated.
2019-11-21 09:35:02 <shachaf> You just said it doesn't make sense to resolve on it again.
2019-11-21 09:35:39 <int-e> I mean, resolution proofs /must/ typically resolve on the same variable several times for completeness.
2019-11-21 09:36:07 <int-e> shachaf: No, *I* said that it doesn't happen when finding a backjump clause.
2019-11-21 09:36:18 <int-e> But that's ignoring the history of the clauses involved in that.
2019-11-21 09:38:57 <int-e> So we talked past each other for a bit, because apprently you care about that history. I'm inclined to say that you shouldn't care.
2019-11-21 09:41:26 <shachaf> I'm not sure what you mean.
2019-11-21 09:45:41 <int-e> shachaf: When deriving a backjump clause by going back through the trail and resolving the conflict clause with the reason given for each literal, you will not resolve on the same variable twice because the variable you resolve on corresponds to the literal on the trail, and the trail is supposed to be free of duplicates and conflicting literals.
2019-11-21 09:46:46 <int-e> shachaf: it's only when you look into the derivation of the referred clauses (if they're learned clauses) that you may be resolving on the same variable more than once.
2019-11-21 09:47:12 <shachaf> Wait, how do you resolve through the trail?
2019-11-21 09:48:10 <shachaf> What I do for FirstUIP is: Take the all-false clause; take a unit-propagated literal from it, and find the clause it was propagated from; resolve it with that clause to get a bigger clause.
2019-11-21 09:48:39 <shachaf> And keep doing that with the new clause until there's only one literal from this level in it.
2019-11-21 09:49:30 <int-e> Yes. The unit-propagated literal is from the trail. The variable you resolve on corresponds to that literal.
2019-11-21 09:50:19 <int-e> Maybe I'm begin stupid but I see no reason why you'd involve the same literal twice in the conflict analysis.
2019-11-21 09:50:37 <shachaf> Sure, it's from the trail, but you don't find it by just looking back through the trail, do you?
2019-11-21 09:50:44 <shachaf> Hmm.
2019-11-21 09:51:22 <shachaf> Maybe you just do?
2019-11-21 09:51:26 <int-e> Note: When a literal is derived by unit propagation using a clause C, *all* variables of C are on the trail at that point. You can't re-introduce variables that come later on the trail by resolving with C.
2019-11-21 09:51:37 <shachaf> Maybe the code I wrote was way too complicated.
2019-11-21 09:52:37 <int-e> So as long as you pick the /last/ literal of the conflict clause from the trail (that is, the one that comes last on the trail) and its corresponding clause to resolve with, you will not resolve on the same variable twice.
2019-11-21 09:53:05 <shachaf> Ah, but I'm just picking an arbitrary one.
2019-11-21 09:53:27 <shachaf> Now what you said makes more sense.
2019-11-21 09:53:37 <int-e> Then I'm not sure. But don't you risk missing the last UIP then?
2019-11-21 09:53:55 <shachaf> Do you still find the first UIP?
2019-11-21 09:54:27 <int-e> Oh right we're looking from the end of the trail. So I mean first.
2019-11-21 09:54:49 <int-e> The last UIP can't be missed, it's the backtracking case.
2019-11-21 09:56:55 <int-e> Take what I'm saying with a grain of salt... I'm missing technical details of how conflict analysis is really done. I have a pen&paper view on how backjump clauses are supposed to work.
2019-11-21 09:58:01 <int-e> But that view definitely involves going through the trail in a backwards fashion. But maybe that's for convenience and not out of necessity.
2019-11-21 09:58:48 <shachaf> I think what you say makes more sense than what I was thinking.
2019-11-21 09:59:22 <shachaf> I was just picking an arbitrary unit each time.
2019-11-21 09:59:35 <shachaf> I mean arbitrary unit-propagated literal from this level.
2019-11-21 09:59:52 <shachaf> Now I need to think about how to implement the thing you said and some other things.
2019-11-21 09:59:59 <shachaf> Probably not today.
2019-11-21 10:04:04 <int-e> shachaf: out of curiosity, which imperfect programming language are you using for this?
2019-11-21 10:04:22 <shachaf> C.
2019-11-21 10:05:45 <int-e> Hmm. Fun. I expected C++ or Rust (well, no, but those are the ones I'd consider if I'd embark on this journey.)

2019-11-21 10:06:48 <int-e> (C++ mostly for sane namespaces... and probably vectors out of laziness)
2019-11-21 10:07:13 <shachaf> I did give in and use https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_ds.h at one point.
2019-11-21 10:07:14 <myname> int-e: out of curiosity, which programming language is not imperfect?
2019-11-21 10:07:18 <int-e> Not for inheritance, virtual methods, exceptions, or templates.
2019-11-21 10:07:22 <int-e> myname: Brainfuck.
2019-11-21 10:07:29 <myname> how so
2019-11-21 10:07:43 <shachaf> int-e: Vectors are great for SAT solvers because there's a lot of linear algebra involved.
2019-11-21 10:07:53 <int-e> myname: There's this quote. "There are two kind of programming languages. Those that everybody complains about and those that nobody uses."
2019-11-21 10:08:06 <int-e> myname: Brainfuck is pretty much perfect for what it does.
2019-11-21 10:08:18 <myname> int-e: in this case, malbolge would be a lot better
2019-11-21 10:08:32 <int-e> No, Malbolge is overcomplicated. :P
2019-11-21 10:08:47 <shachaf> I'm using these dynamic arrays for watch lists. But I suspect I'll replace them with some other data structure anyway eventually.
2019-11-21 10:08:58 <myname> but a lot of people are "using" brainfuck
2019-11-21 10:09:21 <int-e> myname: The original purpose of Brainfuck was not to make programming hard. The purpose was to allow writing small compiler.
2019-11-21 10:09:34 <int-e> +a
2019-11-21 10:10:33 <int-e> shachaf: I'm not sure to what extend you're kidding about the linear algebra.
2019-11-21 10:10:51 <int-e> *extent
2019-11-21 10:11:18 <shachaf> I think std::vector is useful because I often want to apply scalar multiplication to my arrays.
2019-11-21 10:11:45 <int-e> myname: The "imperfect" was an oblique reference to earlier discussions with shachaf about whether there are any good programming languages out there.
2019-11-21 10:12:07 <int-e> myname: We have yet to find one.
2019-11-21 10:12:25 <myname> what about lambda calculus=
2019-11-21 10:12:27 <myname> ?
2019-11-21 10:13:09 <int-e> We can't even agree on whether Haskell is a good programming language.
2019-11-21 10:13:44 <shachaf> Good for what?
2019-11-21 10:13:50 <int-e> (I think yes. shachaf complains about the huge performance overheads. I can't say that he's wrong, it's just not the primary thing I'm looking for in a programming language most of the time.)
2019-11-21 10:14:38 <shachaf> I don't think that's the only thing I complain about.
2019-11-21 10:15:35 <int-e> myname: Lambda calculus is a nice Turing tarpit, and somewhat surprisingly scales up to real programming (according to some people) if you add types, data types, and a few other things.
2019-11-21 10:15:50 <shachaf> Can you give me a nice definition of PTIME and PSPACE for lambda calculus?
2019-11-21 10:16:53 <int-e> Sure, just use a graph model and measure term size and count reduction steps.
2019-11-21 10:16:59 <int-e> Maybe that's not nice enough for you.
2019-11-21 10:18:02 <shachaf> Turing machines are obviously scow to program on.
2019-11-21 10:18:02 <int-e> (Hmm, I may have to go the explicit substituition route.)
2019-11-21 10:18:04 * int-e shrugs.
2019-11-21 10:18:09 <myname> int-e: well, typed lambda calculus is not that far away from haskell, isn't it?
2019-11-21 10:18:25 <shachaf> But at least Turing machines are in spirit similar to actual machines.
2019-11-21 10:18:26 <int-e> myname: what did you think I meant by "real programming"? :P
2019-11-21 10:19:21 <myname> okay

2019-11-21 10:19:54 <wib_jonas> int-e: "term size" how? count the nodes with reusable reference-counted nodes, or serialize the expression so you can blow up space usage exponentially in time?
2019-11-21 10:20:23 <wib_jonas> oh, you said graph model
2019-11-21 10:20:39 <wib_jonas> so the former
2019-11-21 10:21:22 <shachaf> Do you like stb_ds.h?
2019-11-21 10:21:23 <int-e> tbh, graph models are not very nice from a theoretical perspective.
2019-11-21 10:21:59 <int-e> If you really want to go *that* route maybe drop the lamdba calculus and do interaction nets instead.
2019-11-21 10:22:00 <myname> petri nets!
2019-11-21 10:22:22 <int-e> no, not petri nets
2019-11-21 10:22:44 <myname> :(
2019-11-21 10:27:04 <int-e> . o O ( I prefer multiset rewriting ;-) )
2019-11-21 10:28:21 <shachaf> âŸ…1,1,2âŸ†
2019-11-21 10:28:44 <int-e> unordered string rewrting = multiset rewriting = Petri nets if you interpret the symbols as places and the rules as transitions.

2019-11-21 14:13:54 <wib_jonas> kspalaiologos: no, I defined msg1 to experiment with the bot, since defining a command seems to be the easiest way to do that
2019-11-21 14:14:12 <wib_jonas> I just defined various different temporary bf snippets to that command, and didn't bother deleting it
2019-11-21 14:14:27 <wib_jonas> I wanted to check if the bot still isn't willing to print any non-ascii bytes
2019-11-21 14:14:36 <wib_jonas> and apparently it still isn't
2019-11-21 14:18:41 <kspalaiologos> I will patch it

2019-11-21 22:36:07 <fizzie> `` echo $HOME  # Hm, I didn't realize this was set.

2019-11-21 22:36:43 <fizzie> Guess it's usual for HackEso-golfing, since ~ is shorter than /tmp.

2019-11-21 22:42:57 <b_jonas> ok this is wierd: ~ is not actually a valid character in an IRC nickname, and if you try to nick to a nickname containing it, you get an error. but if you whois ~[ the server knows that it's case-insensitively the same as the valid nick ^[ and gives you answer about him.
2019-11-21 22:43:49 <b_jonas> I wonder if this is because it is a valid nickname character on other servers so freenode tries to be compatible or something
2019-11-21 22:48:04 <fizzie> I guess arguably if you say "CASEMAPPING=rfc1459" you should use that case-mapping, even if ~ isn't supported.
2019-11-21 22:48:19 <fizzie> (Wasn't this network ascii at some point?)
2019-11-21 22:48:39 <b_jonas> fizzie: the casemapping matters for channel names
2019-11-21 22:48:50 <b_jonas> fizzie: and yes, the casemapping on freenode changed when they changed services
2019-11-21 22:49:04 <b_jonas> and I still don't know what they did with nickserv registrations that suddenly started to clash
2019-11-21 22:49:11 <b_jonas> or channel registrations
2019-11-21 22:49:19 <b_jonas> but all that is old history, they changed very long ago
2019-11-21 22:53:49 <fizzie> Hm, I wonder why umlbox has code to cfmakeraw() on the input/output terminals, and why it enables that if the output (outside UML) is *not* going to a terminal.

2019-11-21 22:55:11 <kingoffrance> i thought that was the use of "raw" mode: specifically for <things that are not terminals, so dont do any "cooked" "processed" i/o magic>
2019-11-21 22:55:17 <kingoffrance> that sounds like a good thing to me
2019-11-21 22:59:18 <fizzie> Maybe that makes sense. I'm just not sure what effect it has here.
2019-11-21 23:01:11 <fizzie> The commit message just says "Make sure everything is uncooked."
2019-11-21 23:03:10 <kingoffrance> my understanding is unixy things assumes serial devices have a terminal, so you generally want to set the device to "raw" if you arent running getty or whatever on it
2019-11-21 23:03:20 <kingoffrance> s/have a terminal/& attached/
2019-11-21 23:03:58 <kingoffrance> in other words, unixy things might "translate" i/o back and forth on that serial port unless you set "raw" mode to tell it "dont mess with the data flowing"
2019-11-21 23:04:39 <kingoffrance> "translate" meaning alter/otherwise mangle/etc.

2019-11-21 23:08:31 <kingoffrance> as to how is this relevant to non-serial ports, e.g. pseudo-terminal devices, my guess is that is what they are "modelling" or "impersonating"
2019-11-21 23:13:57 <fizzie> Well, I'm just wondering what the UML kernel does, and how that will change if you connect the thing to a tty vs. a non-tty.
2019-11-21 23:14:09 <fizzie> I've definitely noticed that, in verbose mode when redirecting output, it leaves the actual outside-UML terminal in a raw mode (or at least disables echo), which I think happens because it sees the stdout isn't a tty, so it sets raw mode even for the verbose output, which is in fact connected to a tty.
2019-11-21 23:14:14 <fizzie> So it does some amount of "forwarding" of these attributes.
