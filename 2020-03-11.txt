2020-03-11 00:14:16 <arseniiv> was here a holy war about whether ++ and -- (and specifically, both prefix and postfix kinds of these) are such a good thing in a language?

2020-03-11 00:15:06 <ais523> just putting this out there for people who are interested: I've made a draft of what a 10+halt-waterclock interpreter for a TC language in The Waterfall Model could look like: http://nethack4.org/pastebin/and-high-rise.txt
2020-03-11 00:15:13 <b_jonas> arseniiv: not really a hot holy war, but python and ruby silently don't have them
2020-03-11 00:15:32 <ais523> I haven't proved this TC, nor implemented the actual interpreter yet
2020-03-11 00:15:42 <ais523> just described the basic design and what all the waterclocks are used for
2020-03-11 00:15:47 <ais523> so it's quite possible there's a mistake
2020-03-11 00:15:50 <ais523> but I thought I'd post it anyway
2020-03-11 00:16:08 <ais523> it's almost certainly possible to do better than 10 but I thought I'd err on the side of producing something TC
2020-03-11 00:16:42 <arseniiv> b_jonas: yeah Python is amidst sane ones here :) (for what I think)

2020-03-11 00:17:29 <b_jonas> ais523: do you also have a suspected order of magnitude on the upper bound of the waterfall matrix elements, as a function of the program size in some other more well-known computational model?
2020-03-11 00:17:32 <arseniiv> ais523: The Waterfall Model is nice
2020-03-11 00:17:44 <b_jonas> I'd like to know how many exponentials you need
2020-03-11 00:18:16 <ais523> b_jonas: two of the matrix exponents are probably single-exponential in the size of a 2-tag system that emulates the program
2020-03-11 00:18:30 User Name: MtGBusyBeaver = MtGBusyBeaver!4c69b9e2@c-76-105-185-226.hsd1.or.comcast.net
2020-03-11 00:18:30 <MtGBusyBeaver> I am also curious to how big the initial setup needs to be
2020-03-11 00:18:34 <ais523> err, actually 1, in this construction
2020-03-11 00:18:42 <ais523> MtGBusyBeaver: a double-arrow number is enough, a single-arrow number might not be
2020-03-11 00:18:55 <MtGBusyBeaver> ezpz
2020-03-11 00:19:10 <ais523> I wasn't quite sure how powerful the pre-BB layers would be
2020-03-11 00:19:34 <ais523> if you can reconfigure the machine between iterations you can make do with small numbers by constructing a Waterfall Model program whose purpose is to output a large number rather than to be a UTM
2020-03-11 00:19:35 <MtGBusyBeaver> they are less powerful for sure, but they are still layers
2020-03-11 00:19:57 <MtGBusyBeaver> so they are roughly one arrow each
2020-03-11 00:19:58 <b_jonas> ais523: yes, but how about a 150***3 or 150***4 number? I'd like to know how many exponentials you need. a double arrow number like 150***150 is likely enough.
2020-03-11 00:20:05 <ais523> but I figured you'd probably find a way to create a double-arrow number
2020-03-11 00:20:27 <ais523> b_jonas: well, the issue is that you're encoding the UTM you want to run as the digits of a number
2020-03-11 00:20:30 <b_jonas> not many of even your esolanguages need more than a few levels of exponential to simulate something sane
2020-03-11 00:20:32 <ais523> so it's exponential in the size of the UTM
2020-03-11 00:20:43 <b_jonas> ais523: yes, there are no inputs, only program
2020-03-11 00:20:52 <b_jonas> both in the turing machine you run and the waterfall program
2020-03-11 00:21:07 <ais523> I believed I only used a double-exponential (2**(2**x)) once, and even in that situation it later turned out to be unnecessary
2020-03-11 00:21:07 <b_jonas> that's why I asked as a function of the program size
2020-03-11 00:21:11 <ais523> *I believe
2020-03-11 00:21:11 <MtGBusyBeaver> we can probably make something like 5-7 arrows with just what we have
2020-03-11 00:22:00 <b_jonas> ais523: though I guess in this case I have to ask this restricted to less than a hundred waterclocks, regardless of input program size, to be more relevant for M:tG
2020-03-11 00:22:10 <ais523> b_jonas: this is a specific construction with 10 waterclocks
2020-03-11 00:22:15 <ais523> + a halt waterclock
2020-03-11 00:22:25 <ais523> that I haven't figured out the details of yet, but have a basic plan for
2020-03-11 00:22:43 <b_jonas> MtGBusyBeaver: I also guess that just a double arrow number like 150***150 should be enough for most programs
2020-03-11 00:22:56 <b_jonas> four arrows like you mentioned earlier should be more than enough
2020-03-11 00:22:58 <ais523> the idea is to implement a version of High Rise in base 3 where carrying is disallowed, sequences 0 and 1 are empty, and sequence 2 alternates between a geometric progression and 0
2020-03-11 00:23:47 <ais523> that High Rise language, I'm about 99% confident has a fairly direct implementation of 2-tag
2020-03-11 00:23:54 <MtGBusyBeaver> well once we run one BB we have access to that number so iterations really grow very fast
2020-03-11 00:24:23 <ais523> via arranging the base of sequence 2's geometric progression so that the distances between pairs of 2s in the data string (with one intervening 2 between them) represent tag system elements
2020-03-11 00:24:26 <b_jonas> MtGBusyBeaver: yes, the question is just how larege you need to start the bootstrapping
2020-03-11 00:24:47 <arseniiv> . o O ( wait, only just now I noticed that zero arrows is the multiplication (and both can be denoted by an empty string), so arrow notation is even better than I thought! )
2020-03-11 00:24:52 <b_jonas> it almost certainly won't be a problem in your M:tG construction, but I'm still curious for reasons other than that construction
2020-03-11 00:24:55 <ais523> and I'm also fairly confident that a The Waterfall Model program using the waterclock assignment I linked above can be made to implement it
2020-03-11 00:25:09 <MtGBusyBeaver> checking the logs for it
2020-03-11 00:25:42 <MtGBusyBeaver> http://nethack4.org/pastebin/and-high-rise.txt this link?
2020-03-11 00:25:43 <b_jonas> ais523: that should work. and how many exponentials do you need to encode *to* a 2-tag system
2020-03-11 00:25:54 <ais523> now, if you have a double-arrow startup, you could make do with a fixed program (and simply varying the initial waterclock sizes) by writing a UTM in 2-tag and hardcoding that
2020-03-11 00:25:59 <ais523> MtGBusyBeaver: right
2020-03-11 00:26:12 <ais523> MtGBusyBeaver: although it's just a thought dump rather than presented in a way that's easy to follow
2020-03-11 00:26:17 <ais523> https://esolangs.org/wiki/High_Rise might help for some context
2020-03-11 00:26:48 <ais523> I will probably end up writing out the explicit proofs and Waterfall Model machine at some point, but likely not in the next few days because I have a day job
2020-03-11 00:27:14 <ais523> b_jonas: I don't know offhand how complex UTMs in 2-tag are
2020-03-11 00:27:15 <b_jonas> nice
2020-03-11 00:27:43 <b_jonas> ais523: I'm not asking for an UTM there, rather how large the tag system program is as a function of the program you're compiling from
2020-03-11 00:27:49 <ais523> the problem with languages that are "well known" to be TC is that I often haven't proved them TC myself and thus don't have much of an intuitive idea of what the complexities are like
2020-03-11 00:28:03 <b_jonas> ais523: for the Waterfall model, you need an UTM so that the program always fits in 150 or so waterclocks, because the M:tG construction can't handle more
2020-03-11 00:28:23 <ais523> b_jonas: well, this is the usual trick when optimising universal machines
2020-03-11 00:28:38 <ais523> you want your machine to be small, so you want as little code as possible, so much of the complexity is in the data
2020-03-11 00:28:47 <b_jonas> yeah, I guess that's true
2020-03-11 00:28:59 <b_jonas> if you only care about program size, not runtime (and we don't care about runtime here), then an UTM probably helps
2020-03-11 00:29:08 <ais523> just look at, e.g., Three Star Programmer or the I/D machine
2020-03-11 00:29:28 <MtGBusyBeaver> well we have to do shenanigans to get 124 clocks
2020-03-11 00:29:44 <ais523> the interpreters are ridiculously simple and small, but writing a program to do anything is very complex because you have to code all the basic operations you want into the program itself
2020-03-11 00:29:52 <b_jonas> sure
2020-03-11 00:29:55 <MtGBusyBeaver> 12 and under requires much less restriction on the setu
2020-03-11 00:30:01 <MtGBusyBeaver> setup
2020-03-11 00:30:32 <ais523> Three Star Programmer requires a complex one-time setup just to be able to write to specific memory addresses, for example, then needs to neutralise the extra copies of that setup on every future iteration because it has no way to run code only once
2020-03-11 00:30:57 <MtGBusyBeaver> and it looks like 10 is going to be enough for TC-ness
2020-03-11 00:31:00 <ais523> MtGBusyBeaver: that's why I was aiming for 12 as a target, it's nice to have a concrete number rather than continuously worry about if I'm wasting a waterclock somewhere
2020-03-11 00:31:12 <ais523> the 10 is almost certainly improvable, but I can't immediately see how
2020-03-11 00:31:18 <b_jonas> "no way to run code only once" => oh no... Countercall
2020-03-11 00:31:36 <ais523> b_jonas: I think oerjan proved Countercall sub-TC? although I can't remember
2020-03-11 00:31:50 <b_jonas> did he?
2020-03-11 00:32:03 <ais523> it'll be in the IRC logs from around when Countercall was created
2020-03-11 00:32:16 <MtGBusyBeaver> also reading the logs, there are actually two ways for the MTG program to halt
2020-03-11 00:32:22 <MtGBusyBeaver> either by killing them
2020-03-11 00:32:37 <MtGBusyBeaver> or by killing all of the other arcbonded creatures
2020-03-11 00:33:11 <MtGBusyBeaver> the second one can be delayed in a BB method and we can prevent them from dying
2020-03-11 00:34:24 <MtGBusyBeaver> so the creatures with arcbond act as the halting clock
2020-03-11 00:34:36 <ais523> one nice thing about your construction is that I think it has no limit on "self-reset" values, right?
2020-03-11 00:34:43 <ais523> a waterclock that zeroes can set itself to any value
2020-03-11 00:34:49 <MtGBusyBeaver> yes
2020-03-11 00:35:15 <ais523> with the Hungry Lynx construction, I used Elesh Norn partly for the static +2/+2, giving me a self-reset max of 4, because I was worried it might not be high enough
2020-03-11 00:35:26 <ais523> (although I think we subsequently discovered that a self-reset of 3 is enough)
2020-03-11 00:35:50 <ais523> but large self-resets might be needed for the 10-waterclock construction
2020-03-11 00:36:37 <MtGBusyBeaver> the +1/+1 from dralnu's crusade means we can't reset ourself smaller than 2
2020-03-11 00:36:38 <b_jonas> ais523: I'm not entirely sure, but I think oerjan only conjectured that Countercall is not TC, and proved something much weaker
2020-03-11 00:36:44 <ais523> ah, OK
2020-03-11 00:36:54 <ais523> MtGBusyBeaver: there's no issue with low self-resets
2020-03-11 00:36:55 <b_jonas> at least that's what it seems from checking the logs again
2020-03-11 00:36:58 <b_jonas> but it could be hiding anywhere
2020-03-11 00:37:02 <ais523> you can always just increase all the other waterclocks to compensate
2020-03-11 00:37:15 <MtGBusyBeaver> yeah, but it is worth noting
2020-03-11 00:37:35 <ais523> right, definitely worth being aware of all your limitations
2020-03-11 00:38:36 <MtGBusyBeaver> also if you need any of the "growing"/"flooding" type clocks those don't count towards the 12 limit
2020-03-11 00:39:26 <ais523> right, I figured that out; it might be interesting to try to create a UTM with some number of those
2020-03-11 00:39:42 <ais523> you'd want to store data using the length of time the program had been running
2020-03-11 00:40:00 <ais523> even with the help of a few normal clocks, though, it'd be a pain to keep things under control
2020-03-11 00:40:09 <MtGBusyBeaver> yeah it seems really chaotic
2020-03-11 00:40:21 <MtGBusyBeaver> volatile
2020-03-11 00:43:33 <b_jonas> ais523: anyway, it's useful to know that you will probably be able to prove that 10 or 12 clocks are enough
2020-03-11 00:43:55 <b_jonas> for turing-completeness that is
2020-03-11 00:44:07 <MtGBusyBeaver> well that 10 proof looks close so 12 is almost assured
2020-03-11 00:45:11 <b_jonas> oh, since we're talking about M:tG, I wanted to advertise the play-by-post M:tG variant game that we're running: https://forums.giantitp.com/showthread.php?601011
2020-03-11 00:46:55 <MtGBusyBeaver> three card blind always interesting
2020-03-11 00:47:12 <b_jonas> each round, players secretly choose a 3-card deck, then they're revealed, then each deck plays two games against each other deck, you don't lose for drawing from an empty library, all game information that would normally be hidden is known, we figure out the result of each game assuming perfect play,
2020-03-11 00:47:30 <ais523> that sounds like 3-card blind so far
2020-03-11 00:47:41 <ais523> I assume luck always goes against the player who put the luck card in their deck?
2020-03-11 00:47:45 <MtGBusyBeaver> my first forum name was to participate in that on the old WotC
2020-03-11 00:47:48 <MtGBusyBeaver> forums
2020-03-11 00:47:59 <b_jonas> players get a point for a draw and three points for a match won, the player with the most points in that round wins the round and an internet point and right to boast.
2020-03-11 00:48:16 <MtGBusyBeaver> IIRC luck was decided by the opponent
2020-03-11 00:49:21 <b_jonas> ais523: yes, it's 3-card blind, and yes, random choices go against the person who put that card in their deck
2020-03-11 00:51:26 <b_jonas> and it's vanishing, which means that the cards from the deck that won a round are banned from future rounds, except certain cards like basic lands and storage lands are immune to getting banned this way.
2020-03-11 00:52:44 <b_jonas> and you aren't allowed to mulligan, despite that with the latest mulligan rule it would actually help you if you could
2020-03-11 00:53:23 <b_jonas> but apparently the player base is conservative and not used to the new mulligan rule yet, so they don't want to upset the meta from that
2020-03-11 00:55:38 <ais523> I can't think of many situations where you'd prefer to have a card in your deck than in your hand
2020-03-11 00:55:46 <MtGBusyBeaver> miracles
2020-03-11 00:55:47 <ais523> maybe if you're going second and the opponent is playing Thoughtseize or the like?
2020-03-11 00:55:57 <ais523> oh yes, miracles, didn't think of that one but it's obvious now you said it

2020-03-11 00:56:31 <b_jonas> ais523: that's sort of why the situation didn't come up before the current mulligan rule
2020-03-11 00:56:37 <b_jonas> but read the new mulligan rule:
2020-03-11 00:57:44 <ais523> you put cards from hand on the bottom of your library, so you choose which one you put there
2020-03-11 00:57:49 <ais523> rather than it being random
2020-03-11 00:57:50 <b_jonas> exactly
2020-03-11 00:58:09 <b_jonas> so now it mostly protects you from Burning Inquiry and other discards
2020-03-11 00:58:25 <b_jonas> well, it would
2020-03-11 00:58:31 <b_jonas> not completely, but to a very large amount
2020-03-11 00:58:45 <b_jonas> only we don't allow mulliganing, as a house rule, so nope
2020-03-11 00:59:12 <ais523> well, you have a house rule to not lose by outdraw
2020-03-11 00:59:21 <ais523> but that can happen during mulligans in regular MTG
2020-03-11 00:59:24 <ais523> so it's a bit of a weird interaction
2020-03-11 00:59:44 <ais523> (admittedly, it requires Shahrazad to be possible in a black-border game)
2020-03-11 01:00:22 <b_jonas> nevertheless, we did manage to get strange metas from newly released broken cards, most notably the non-black-bordered small print run cards Impatient Iguana and Mirror Lotus
2020-03-11 01:00:34 <b_jonas> s/Mirror Lotus/Mirrored Lotus/
2020-03-11 01:01:52 <ais523> `card-by-name mirrored lotus
2020-03-11 01:01:52 <HackEso> No output.
2020-03-11 01:02:09 <ais523> oh, wait, is this from Unsanctioned?
2020-03-11 01:02:09 <b_jonas> *newly released*
2020-03-11 01:02:13 <b_jonas> no
2020-03-11 01:02:29 <ais523> oh, Mystery Booster Playtest
2020-03-11 01:02:42 <b_jonas> ais523: technically does not require Shahrazad anymore, because of Karn Liberated, but that won't come up in a real game, because you'll win before it'd happen
2020-03-11 01:02:46 <b_jonas> ais523: yes
2020-03-11 01:02:50 <ais523> that isn't a silver-bordered card, it has a black border and a "not for constructed play" footer
2020-03-11 01:03:06 <b_jonas> ais523: I didn't say silver-bordered, I only said non-black-bordered
2020-03-11 01:03:14 <b_jonas> also not gold bordered
2020-03-11 01:03:24 <b_jonas> I'm not sure if it technically counts as having any border
2020-03-11 01:03:34 <ais523> the border is black, though, with a few intrusions
2020-03-11 01:03:53 <MtGBusyBeaver> oh the playtest cards
2020-03-11 01:03:54 <b_jonas> but isn't that just the border of the card that the playtest sticker is sticked on?
2020-03-11 01:04:10 <b_jonas> the properties of that card shouldn't matter
2020-03-11 01:04:19 <b_jonas> even if you can somehow see them
2020-03-11 01:04:40 <ais523> b_jonas: the underlying card is part of the card, as printed, though
2020-03-11 01:04:45 <ais523> the sticker is also part of the card
2020-03-11 01:04:51 <ais523> they're on the same print sheet and printed together
2020-03-11 01:05:03 <b_jonas> that said, there probably won't be a judgement on this, because there are only three un-cards that care about whether a card is black-bordered
2020-03-11 01:05:12 <ais523> so the underlying card is part of the card; most of its properties don't matter because there's a sticker over it, but I'd argue it determines the border color
2020-03-11 01:05:22 <b_jonas> ais523: yes, but the underlying card shouldn't matter to determine characteristics
2020-03-11 01:05:30 <b_jonas> well I don't know
2020-03-11 01:06:22 <ais523> the sticker doesn't cover the border
2020-03-11 01:06:24 <b_jonas> maybe they are black-bordered then
2020-03-11 01:06:38 <ais523> it's a bit like host/augment, parts of the card are covered by the augment but those parts that aren't still count
2020-03-11 01:06:48 <ais523> or Curse of the Fire Penguin
2020-03-11 01:06:53 <ais523> `card-by-name curse of the fire penguin
2020-03-11 01:06:54 <HackEso> Curse of the Fire Penguin \ 4RR \ Enchantment -- Aura \ Enchant creature \ Curse of the Fire Penguin consumes and confuses enchanted creature. \ UNH-R \  \ Curse of the Fire Penguin Creature \ 4RR \ Creature -- Penguin \ 6/5 \ Trample \ When this creature dies, return Curse of the Fire Penguin to the battlefield. \ UNH-R
2020-03-11 01:07:17 <ais523> was wondering how the bot would represent that thing
2020-03-11 01:07:20 <ais523> I guess that's a decent effort
2020-03-11 01:07:38 <b_jonas> ais523: I don't think playtest stickers are like that. if they were, I'd make an Ulamog proxy such that the sticker happens to not cover the mana cost {W}
2020-03-11 01:07:51 <ais523> b_jonas: the cards in question are not playtest stickers
2020-03-11 01:07:58 <ais523> they're cards whose design /looks/ like a playtest sticker
2020-03-11 01:08:23 <b_jonas> sure
2020-03-11 01:08:25 <ais523> but the sticker and underlying card are part of the same printed card, and in particular the underlying card is always the same
2020-03-11 01:08:34 <b_jonas> and admittedly they made a good job where the playtest sticker covers almost everything
2020-03-11 01:09:16 <ais523> I think I'd take border color and frame color from the underlying card, but pinline color from the sticker
2020-03-11 01:09:28 <b_jonas> ok, then they're black-bordered cards that aren't valid for tournaments
2020-03-11 01:09:33 <ais523> that said, I'm not sure if M:tG will ever have a card that cares about pinline color
2020-03-11 01:09:34 <MtGBusyBeaver> Form of the mulldrifter is clearly on a mulldrifter though
2020-03-11 01:09:44 <ais523> even silver-bordered
2020-03-11 01:10:02 <b_jonas> that category already exists I think, because I think some very low print run cards were printed as black bordered with square corners rather than gold bordered
2020-03-11 01:10:30 <b_jonas> pinline color would be tricky because pre-Mirrodin cards don't have it
2020-03-11 01:10:53 <b_jonas> MtGBusyBeaver: heh, indeed
2020-03-11 01:12:40 <b_jonas> MtGBusyBeaver: and One with Death is on One with Nothing
2020-03-11 01:13:07 <ais523> One with Death is actually a fairly good card in constructed, IIRC
2020-03-11 01:13:26 <ais523> because there are a few combos that force your opponent to resolve one of your spells, and that's about the strongest possible payoff for one of those
2020-03-11 01:15:04 <b_jonas> ais523: that sounds a bit hard to do. isn't the normal route just donating an Illusions of Grandeur or a Phage?
2020-03-11 01:16:26 <MtGBusyBeaver> Hive Mind + pact of negation
2020-03-11 01:16:57 <ais523> I think Hive Mind is the most common core of the combo
2020-03-11 01:16:59 <ais523> `card-by-name Hive Mind
2020-03-11 01:17:00 <HackEso> Hive Mind \ 5U \ Enchantment \ Whenever a player casts an instant or sorcery spell, each other player copies that spell. Each of those players may choose new targets for their copy. \ M10-R
2020-03-11 01:17:14 <ais523> you don't even need anything else when using One With Death because the opponent's copy resolves first
2020-03-11 01:17:48 <ais523> the normal kill in tournaments uses pacts in the hope that the opponent doesn't have the right color of mana to pay for them
2020-03-11 01:18:20 <b_jonas> I see
2020-03-11 01:19:38 <b_jonas> I played a Phage deck twice in the three card blind, got a second place from it once, and that one doesn't try to get the opponent to resolve Phage, just puts it to play under the opponent's control (as one path to win; the other is to just play it and attack with it)

2020-03-11 13:54:11 <wib_jonas> I created a stub at https://esolangs.org/wiki/Orca , and a few months later the person who created this esolang came along and edited more details onto the wiki

2020-03-11 13:57:29 <wib_jonas> I don't know if they came to the wiki because I wrote the stub, or on the other hand the stub was useless and they'd have written the wiki article anyway, though
2020-03-11 13:57:49 <myname> there is much more to explain, though
2020-03-11 13:58:10 <myname> explanations of examples would be lovely
2020-03-11 13:58:46 <wib_jonas> myname: there's a link saying "Tutorial Video on Youtube"
