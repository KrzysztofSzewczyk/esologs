2020-10-09 00:05:49 <fizzie> http://ix.io/2A9t -- with steps.
2020-10-09 00:06:45 <orby> Actually, I think my notation is backwards. I meant for x to be on top of the stack, not on the bottom
2020-10-09 00:06:55 <b_jonas> fizzie: ouch, not writing out the outer parenthesis
2020-10-09 00:07:16 <orby> So I guess a better way of asking my question would be (z)(y)(x) -> ((z)y)(z)x
2020-10-09 00:07:49 <b_jonas> orby: ok that's slightly harder
2020-10-09 00:08:01 <fizzie> That's the problem with stacks, you never know which way around they are.
2020-10-09 00:08:04 <orby> yes, I thought it was hard
2020-10-09 00:08:06 <b_jonas> but you can still compile lambda calculus to underload
2020-10-09 00:08:23 <b_jonas> fizzie: yeah, though at least in underload they're always the way you took it
2020-10-09 00:08:29 <b_jonas> (and in Consumer Society too)
2020-10-09 00:09:12 <orby> I discovered today that there is a single concatenative combinator that is TC with quoting, a la iota in applicative combinator calculus
2020-10-09 00:09:25 <orby> and I'm trying to document it properly as a minimization of underload
2020-10-09 00:10:19 <b_jonas> orby: the concatenative thing is a generalization of combinator calculus, isn't it, so that should be true because combinator calculus has a single universal combinator too
2020-10-09 00:12:38 <orby> b_jonas: I'd have to think about that. I'm not sure how obviously true it is, but I suspected it was true and went searching. It's actually really close to the construction of iota: let k be (y)(x) -> x, s' be (z)(y)(x) -> ((z)y)(z)x, then the sole sufficient combinator takes (x) -> (k)(s')x
2020-10-09 00:12:55 <orby> just a slightly adapted s combinator
2020-10-09 00:13:03 <b_jonas> orby: it's not obvious at all
2020-10-09 00:13:05 <b_jonas> neither part is obvious
2020-10-09 00:13:15 <b_jonas> I still can't wrap my head around how underload works
2020-10-09 00:13:30 <orby> I mostly think of it as a term rewriting system
2020-10-09 00:13:34 <orby> I find that easier to think about
2020-10-09 00:13:45 <b_jonas> as for the single generator for combinator calculus, I never bothered to try to understand that, it seems like a useless bit of trivia to me, hh
2020-10-09 00:13:55 <b_jonas> but I think other people have verified it because it's not that hard with a computer these days
2020-10-09 00:14:09 <orby> I have a minor fetish for minimization, so I spend a lot of time thinking about reducing these sorts of things
2020-10-09 00:14:21 <fizzie> This starts from a slightly different place:
2020-10-09 00:14:22 <fizzie> ^ul ((z)a(y)a(x)a)^**:^!~a~*a~^~!~a~**S

2020-10-09 00:23:16 <b_jonas> orby: but the basic recipe is this. you want to do something with (x0)(x1)...(xn) on stack. first apply () ~a~* ... ~a~* ~a~* on it to fold it to one term ((x0)(x1)...(xn)); then L: duplicate or triplicate that with : or ::; then get a single term like (xk) from the top copy with like ^!...! ~!~!...~!~!; then possibly flip and get a single term from the middle one; then do one step of whatever you
2020-10-09 00:23:22 <b_jonas> wanted; then fold the result back into the bottom list with a*; then keep repeating this from L until you have every term you need separated inside one long list.
2020-10-09 00:23:36 <b_jonas> but there's of course a lot of optimizations you can do on this.

2020-10-09 00:34:48 <ais523> normally "write this combinator in Underload" is pretty straightforward if you know what you want the result to look like
2020-10-09 00:34:57 <ais523> it can be done mechanically, if necessary
2020-10-09 00:35:06 <ais523> sometimes you can do it in your head, that's the hard part
2020-10-09 00:35:15 <b_jonas> ais523: you have read tom7's very apt description of git and the world around it, right?
2020-10-09 00:35:30 <orby> ais523: Yeah, I need to spend a little more time with Underload
2020-10-09 00:35:38 <ais523> b_jonas: no
2020-10-09 00:35:49 <b_jonas> I think I understand enough about git to use it, and I still think it's a very good description
2020-10-09 00:36:02 <ais523> orby: let me try this; the problem is to define C such that (z)(y)(x)C is equivalent to ((z)y)(z)x, right?
2020-10-09 00:36:13 <b_jonas> ais523: frontpage of http://radar.spacebar.org/ right now
2020-10-09 00:36:19 <orby> ais523: Correct
2020-10-09 00:36:31 <b_jonas> permalink: http://radar.spacebar.org/f/a/weblog/comment/1/1185
2020-10-09 00:36:35 <ais523> b_jonas: ouch, that's unreadably narrow, and I don't get a reaer mode option
2020-10-09 00:37:04 <b_jonas> ais523: go complain to tom7 then
2020-10-09 00:37:08 <orby> What you are calling C I am calling S' in line with the notation used in "The theory of concatenative combinators" by Brent Kirby
2020-10-09 00:37:21 <ais523> wow, this site uses tables for layout
2020-10-09 00:37:53 <ais523> and specifies widths as an exact number of pixels
2020-10-09 00:38:17 <b_jonas> ais523: yes, it's a blog that has existed continuously since 2000, with a new post every month, and tom7 just rewrote the script that serves it in a second programming language, where both of them are programming languages that he made himself
2020-10-09 00:39:07 <b_jonas> basically rewrote it to a newer, incompatible evolution of his own scripting language
2020-10-09 00:40:12 <ais523> there we go
2020-10-09 00:40:19 <b_jonas> the same scripting language that implements http://snoot.org/
2020-10-09 00:41:52 <ais523> I think the problem with git is that it solves a problem in a very simple, elegant, and straightforward way, but unfortunately it isn't the problem that git users actually wanted it to solve
2020-10-09 00:43:25 <b_jonas> the table was 546 wide, specified in a plain HTML attribute, no CSS, since 2000 apparently: view-source:https://web.archive.org/web/20001018141700/http://radar.spacebar.org/

2020-10-09 00:44:52 <ais523> what have I done wrong, I wonder? (that was my first attempt done in my head, no helper programs)

2020-10-09 00:44:59 <fungot> (z)x((z)y)
2020-10-09 00:45:07 <ais523> just didn't print out the stack properly
2020-10-09 00:45:32 <ais523> actually, I think I have one level of quoting too much
2020-10-09 00:45:56 <ais523> ^ul (z)(y)(x)(~a:(~*)~a*^)~a*^
2020-10-09 00:46:05 <ais523> ^ul (z)(y)(x)(~a:(~*)~a*^)~a*^SSS
2020-10-09 00:46:05 <fungot> x(z)(z)y
2020-10-09 00:46:14 <ais523> yep, that looks right

2020-10-09 00:46:18 <fungot> (x)((z))((z)y)
2020-10-09 00:46:24 <ais523> orby: there you go
2020-10-09 00:47:09 <ais523> or, hmm, (z) is still quoted too much
2020-10-09 00:47:14 <b_jonas> ais523: yeah. in particular, what I want solved is much closer to what svn solves than what git solves. an svn repository explicitly tracks what files in earlier versions are ancestors of a file, and which changes from a branch are merged into it and which aren't, even if I merge later changes from a branch but not merge earlier ones. git stores some of this and guesses about the rest heuristically, and
2020-10-09 00:47:20 <ais523> ^ul (z)(y)(x)(~:(a~*)~a*^)~a*^aSaSaS
2020-10-09 00:47:20 <fungot> (x)(z)((z)y)
2020-10-09 00:47:20 <b_jonas> there's no easy way to make it remember what I think instead of what it guesses.
2020-10-09 00:47:29 <ais523> ^ul (z)(y)(x)(~:(a~*)~a*^)~a*^^
2020-10-09 00:47:29 <fungot> ...bad insn!
2020-10-09 00:47:42 <ais523> the x in orby's example wasn't in parens, so that runs it
2020-10-09 00:47:46 <ais523> ^ul (z)(y)(SS)(~:(a~*)~a*^)~a*^^
2020-10-09 00:47:46 <fungot> z(z)y
2020-10-09 00:47:51 <b_jonas> and svn also does partial checkouts or partial read-only replication.
2020-10-09 00:49:00 <ais523> it's frustrating, I have ideas about how to write a VCS but am unlikely to actually write it
2020-10-09 00:49:09 <b_jonas> what I'd like is the best of svn but distributed. I should probably learn how the heck mercurial works. I think mercurial is probably better than git in some respects, worse in others, it won't solve all my problems, but at least I could learn something from it about version control.
2020-10-09 00:49:38 <ais523> one thing I don't like about Mercurial is that branches are expensive
2020-10-09 00:49:48 <b_jonas> ais523: yeah, me too. I'd like to write one that's based on svn, but makes it a distributed version control system. I might try to write something like it, but it won't be working stable enough.
2020-10-09 00:50:18 <ais523> some of svn's features, like consecutive revision numbers, seem somewhat incompatible with typical DVCS usage patterns
2020-10-09 00:50:27 <b_jonas> ais523: yes. svn does everything that it wants to do inexpensively, but sadly there are a few things that it really doesn't want to do, and those are expensive because you have to work them around.
2020-10-09 00:50:43 <ais523> this reminds me about my eso-idea of a git hash bruteforcer
2020-10-09 00:50:58 <ais523> so that the short hashes given to commits were in consecutive numerical order (possibly in decimal rather than hex)
2020-10-09 00:51:09 <ais523> i.e. the first revision is 0000001, the second is 0000002, and so on

2020-10-09 00:51:27 <int-e> yuck :)
2020-10-09 00:51:27 <ais523> but it turns out that there actually isn't much you can change to make the hash match, apart from the commit message
2020-10-09 00:51:48 <ais523> maybe you could mess with the whitespace
2020-10-09 00:52:50 <b_jonas> ais523: yes, but that just means that referring to stuff with version numbers won't be such a good idea anymore. that's not a problem. some web forums (of at least three different engines) have the same problem: in theory they number messages within a thread with consecutive numbers, so people sometimes refer to them by number in replies, but in practice moderation can cause new messages to appear with
2020-10-09 00:52:56 <b_jonas> older timestamps or older messages to disappear, such as when messages are moved among threads, in which case those numbers aren't stable, and the replies will be confusing.
2020-10-09 00:53:38 <ais523> I mod on a phpBB forum and I will normally edit messages down rather than delete them, for this reason
2020-10-09 00:53:46 <b_jonas> specifically this happens on at least one wordpress blog's comment section, most phpbb forums, and http://www.komal.hu/forum which has its own engine
2020-10-09 00:53:50 <ais523> (if the content is inappropriate and needs to be removed)
2020-10-09 00:53:51 <int-e> just mess with the committer name ;-)

2020-10-09 00:56:17 <b_jonas> "git hash bruteforcer" => well yes, using SHA-1 and saying that it's ok because you'll only commit trustable data into the vcs rather than admitting that it's hard to change the hash function is a stupid decision, and using only 7 hexits is another stupid decision, but at least the latter isn't baked into git so I don't care
2020-10-09 00:56:33 <esowiki> 14[[07Sea14]]4 10 02https://esolangs.org/w/index.php?diff=77887&oldid=75326 5* 03Orby 5* (+1159) 10Introducing Sea: a three command simple translation of Underload
2020-10-09 00:56:53 <ais523> b_jonas: the 7 nybble thing is actually not a requirement, it will expand to 8 (and possibly more?) in cases of collision
2020-10-09 00:56:59 <ais523> all the nybbles are stored internally
2020-10-09 00:57:14 <b_jonas> ais523: yes, I know
2020-10-09 00:57:46 <b_jonas> ais523: I even have core.abbrev=16 in my global git settings
2020-10-09 00:57:54 <b_jonas> which makes it list 16 hexits by default
2020-10-09 00:58:02 <b_jonas> that's still not all of the hash, but better than 8
2020-10-09 00:58:07 <b_jonas> and for some purposes I make it list all the hexits
2020-10-09 00:58:18 <b_jonas> like when it needn't be human-readable, but stored for machines
2020-10-09 00:58:23 <ais523> why do you say "hexit" rather than "nybble"? hmm, maybe people wouldn't refer to a base-256 digit as a "byte"
2020-10-09 00:58:26 <b_jonas> git does that in its internal stuff too obviously, it's not that stupid
2020-10-09 00:58:36 <b_jonas> ais523: it can be nybble too, sure
2020-10-09 00:58:59 <b_jonas> hexit is the text format numeral, nybble is the actual number
2020-10-09 00:59:26 <ais523> anyway, an idea I had recently: using algebraic numbers as the internal numerical type for a language
2020-10-09 00:59:38 <b_jonas> so "A" is a hexit (except in git which uses lower case, another thing I hate, but at least it's consistent with the rest of the kernel, which also uses lowercase in a lot of debug messages and /proc and /sys text files), 0xA is a nybble
2020-10-09 00:59:56 <b_jonas> ais523: that's actually rather hard to implement
2020-10-09 01:00:10 <b_jonas> but there are other choices for esoteric number systems that are easier to implement
2020-10-09 01:00:15 <ais523> this would be particularly good for declarative languages: if all you have is + - * ÷ ==, everything is fully closed except for division by 0 (which in a declarative language is not an error)
2020-10-09 01:00:27 <ais523> it doesn't seem ridiculously hard to implement, just inefficient
2020-10-09 01:00:47 <b_jonas> oh if you don't implement < or rootof, then it's much easier
2020-10-09 01:00:53 <b_jonas> but then it's much harder to use for anything useful
2020-10-09 01:01:01 <b_jonas> because you can't get one of the square roots in any way
2020-10-09 01:01:02 <ais523> rootof effectively exists within this set of operations
2020-10-09 01:01:11 <int-e> ais523: I guess you could mess with the commit message and disguise it... say, have every commit message end in a weather forecast and a fortune.
2020-10-09 01:01:24 <ais523> in a declarative language, you just need to assign, say, X * X = 2 and then X is set to one of the square roots of 2
2020-10-09 01:01:29 <b_jonas> no, you can only get all the roots of a polynomial nondeterministically, and you can't distingiush among algebraic conjugates
2020-10-09 01:01:44 <b_jonas> ais523: you can't even distinguish between sqrt(2) and sqrt(-2)
2020-10-09 01:01:44 <ais523> yes, you can't get at any specific root
2020-10-09 01:01:51 <int-e> But yeah, the formats look rather rigid.
2020-10-09 01:01:52 <b_jonas> ais523: I assume you have 1 as a built-in too, right?
2020-10-09 01:02:00 <int-e> Which is a good thing, of course.
2020-10-09 01:02:11 <ais523> b_jonas: you can distinguish between sqrt(2) and sqrt(-2), the former obeys X * X = 2, the latter doesn't
2020-10-09 01:02:14 <b_jonas> or... oh heck
2020-10-09 01:02:19 <ais523> you can't distinguish between sqrt(2) and -sqrt(2), though
2020-10-09 01:02:22 <b_jonas> ais523: yes, sorry, that
2020-10-09 01:02:36 <int-e> (I'm assuming that tree objects must contain entries in byte-based lexicographic order)
2020-10-09 01:02:45 <b_jonas> maybe you want to generate 1 from some polynomial equations or something, that's possible
2020-10-09 01:02:45 <ais523> unfortunately, you can't just store numbers as an entire set of conjugates
2020-10-09 01:02:52 <ais523> because say you have X * X = 2 and Y * Y = 2
2020-10-09 01:03:05 <ais523> then X + Y could nondeterministically be either 0 or sqrt(8)
2020-10-09 01:03:07 <orby> later all
2020-10-09 01:03:11 <ais523> which are not conjugate to each other
2020-10-09 01:03:13 <ais523> orby: later
2020-10-09 01:04:31 <b_jonas> ais523: yes, and that's why you want to have < and <= and rootof as primitives too, where rootof takes a polynomial and an interval, and it returns one of the real roots of the polynomial in that interval.
2020-10-09 01:05:06 <ais523> you don't actually need rootof as a primitive in a declarative language, if you have < and arithmetic
2020-10-09 01:05:17 <ais523> just assign to an equation
2020-10-09 01:05:37 <b_jonas> yeah, I guess in a declarative language you don't need it
2020-10-09 01:05:46 <b_jonas> but the interpreter has to implement it
2020-10-09 01:06:14 <b_jonas> and it's not rootof that's hard to impelement, it's <
2020-10-09 01:06:26 <ais523> yes
2020-10-09 01:06:33 <ais523> actually, < isn't even very well defined
2020-10-09 01:06:40 <b_jonas> why?
2020-10-09 01:06:43 <ais523> complex numbers
2020-10-09 01:06:45 <b_jonas> meh
2020-10-09 01:06:51 <ais523> you need some sort of norm<
2020-10-09 01:06:52 <b_jonas> I consider only real numbers
2020-10-09 01:07:02 <ais523> then it isn't algebraically closed any more
2020-10-09 01:07:21 <b_jonas> if you want complex numbers, then add real part as a primitive too, and < should compare by real part first then imaginary part
2020-10-09 01:07:37 <b_jonas> it doesn't have to be algebraically closed
2020-10-09 01:07:45 <b_jonas> you can simulate complex numbers from real numbers in user space
2020-10-09 01:07:56 <b_jonas> I mean if you have rootof, not just powers
2020-10-09 01:08:19 <b_jonas> complex numbers aren't really harder, they just complicate everything
2020-10-09 01:08:27 <b_jonas> or simplify, depending on which side you're looking form
2020-10-09 01:08:28 <ais523> what's the point of using algebraic numbers, if they don't give you an algebraically closed number system?
2020-10-09 01:08:43 <b_jonas> complicate if you have to implement stuff, simplify if you want to use it
2020-10-09 01:08:52 <b_jonas> yes, I guess you're right
2020-10-09 01:08:56 <b_jonas> so complexes
2020-10-09 01:09:03 <b_jonas> but then you probably want real part as a primitive too
2020-10-09 01:09:13 <b_jonas> and I guess i
2020-10-09 01:09:19 <b_jonas> so you can distinguish between +i and -i
2020-10-09 01:09:26 <b_jonas> but < might do that anyway
2020-10-09 01:09:30 <int-e> Over the reals you have tools for counting roots in an interval.
2020-10-09 01:09:37 <ais523> yes
2020-10-09 01:09:37 <int-e> How do you do that in the complex numbers?
2020-10-09 01:09:45 <b_jonas> int-e: there's probably tools for that oo
2020-10-09 01:09:47 <ais523> I was going to say, is there an equivalent for complex numbers?
2020-10-09 01:09:49 <b_jonas> they're just less elegant
2020-10-09 01:09:57 <ais523> I'm pretty sure root isolation in the complex numbers exists
2020-10-09 01:10:03 <b_jonas> ais523: probably
2020-10-09 01:10:16 <b_jonas> real numbers just have a nice elegant algorithm
2020-10-09 01:10:20 <b_jonas> well, elegant in theory
2020-10-09 01:10:25 <b_jonas> still a hell to work with
2020-10-09 01:10:37 <ais523> Wikipedia has an article on real-root isolation but not complex-root isolation
2020-10-09 01:10:42 <int-e> I've followed one algebraic number development where root separation was a reason for keeping algebraic numbers real.
2020-10-09 01:11:30 <int-e> (And deal with complex numbers as pairs of real algebraic numbers.)
2020-10-09 01:11:35 <b_jonas> ais523: that's because nobody wants to actually implement it in full generality, or even describe it properly in writing. we know it's possible, and Mathematica implements it, let's leave it at that and let the Maxima fanatics deal with it.
2020-10-09 01:12:44 <int-e> Of course what I'm alluding to was a formalization effort... so there was also a strong incentive to keep things (relatively) simple.
2020-10-09 01:13:31 <b_jonas> I don't even know a simple algorithm for deciding if an expression that contains field ops, real square roots, and real cube roots is negative.
2020-10-09 01:13:46 <b_jonas> without cube roots I do know an algorithm that I can explain
2020-10-09 01:14:38 <b_jonas> with cube roots, you would need to work with algebraic numbers nonsense like finding a generator polynomial or something. the practical solution is to ask GAP and let it work its magic.
2020-10-09 01:15:05 <b_jonas> well the practical solution is to decide using interval arithmetic, but if it's zero, then ask GAP to prove it and let it work its magic
2020-10-09 01:15:49 <b_jonas> oh, that reminds me
2020-10-09 01:16:03 <b_jonas> does any of you happen to have a backup of Plouffe's inverter? it fell off the web
2020-10-09 01:16:14 <b_jonas> I don't need it for anything urgent, it would just be nice to have a backup
2020-10-09 01:16:36 <b_jonas> the old address was https://isc.carma.newcastle.edu.au/
2020-10-09 01:20:21 <b_jonas> ais523: anyway, branches being expensive is one of those things that kept me away from mercurial

2020-10-09 01:21:22 <b_jonas> and I can tell why svn+distributed is hard to make work, but it's not the sequential version numbers
2020-10-09 01:22:17 <b_jonas> in the model I imagine there's still a good way to refer to a specific revision, or a file or directory in a revision.
2020-10-09 01:24:00 <int-e> I suppose you found https://oeis.org/wiki/Plouffe's_Inverter (and the reference to ISC+, which is also down, but points to ISC, which is working but presumably far less powerful)
2020-10-09 01:25:08 <b_jonas> the theoretical problem is more like that some operations that I'd expect an ideal distributed vcs should implement efficiently would be implemented rather inefficiently (as in they'd have to rebuild the entire repository); the practical problem is that if I try to code this, it will either never be complete, or it will have so many bugs that can lose you data that the gaps are larger than the features.
2020-10-09 01:25:29 <b_jonas> int-e: no, I actually haven't looked there
2020-10-09 01:25:36 <ais523> git was originally intended to be a VCS backend, rather than a VCS
2020-10-09 01:25:45 <ais523> I'm surprised there aren't more VCSes that use it like that
2020-10-09 01:26:50 <b_jonas> ais523: well, it works quite well as a vcs for the special case of developing the linux kernel, which indeed wants to send patches in email, has lots of distributed developers cherry-picking commits from each other, and puts only trusted text source files in the repository
2020-10-09 01:27:08 <ais523> git is actually very bad at cherry-picks
2020-10-09 01:27:17 <b_jonas> ais523: it doesn't work as a backend for what I want, because it doesn't implement modifyable sparse checkouts
2020-10-09 01:27:37 <ais523> cherry-pick from A into B followed by merge from A into B is an operation that git's model simply doesn't implement
2020-10-09 01:27:41 <b_jonas> ais523: yes, svn is better. but it works in the principled environment of linux kernel environment
2020-10-09 01:27:49 <ais523> it often works in practice, but only due to hacks designed to merge two identical-looking changes into one
2020-10-09 01:28:15 <b_jonas> ais523: yes, that's sort of what I said above about not storing merge metadata
2020-10-09 01:29:27 <b_jonas> ais523: you should also consider the historical context as an excuse though: git is old, svn only started to get merge tracking in the time that I remember, git had the hacks much before that
2020-10-09 01:29:59 <b_jonas> specifically svn adds merge tracking in svn 1.5, which was released ... when?
2020-10-09 01:30:19 <b_jonas> a moment, this is exactly something vcs should be able to tell
2020-10-09 01:30:43 <b_jonas> released in 2008
2020-10-09 01:31:28 <b_jonas> back long ago, when svn was not really ready, and the other contenders weren't anywhere, git was revolutionary
2020-10-09 01:31:37 <b_jonas> it just didn't get developed as much as svn later
2020-10-09 01:31:38 <zzo38> There is also Fossil, where it is stored as a set of artifacts each with identifiers, but I don't know if there are any implementations of the Fossil format other than Fossil itself.
2020-10-09 01:32:05 <b_jonas> and git was what popularized the concept of distributed version control, mercurial and darcs came after that and took the good parts
2020-10-09 01:34:00 <ais523> Mercurial and git were developed at almost the same time, for the same reason
2020-10-09 01:34:02 <b_jonas> I technically used svn in 2008, but not for anything nontrivial, I mostly just checked stuff out
2020-10-09 01:34:27 <b_jonas> ais523: I admit I don't actually know the history, I'm just telling my impressoin
2020-10-09 01:34:40 <ais523> the Linux kernel used to use a proprietary VCS
2020-10-09 01:34:41 Joined: Arcorann
2020-10-09 01:34:42 <b_jonas> I don't know when git gained what features
2020-10-09 01:34:59 <b_jonas> yeah, I heard that, Linus decided to make his own tools, just like Knuth
2020-10-09 01:35:03 <ais523> but someone working on it reverse-engineered part of its internal protocol, so that they could script it more easily or something
2020-10-09 01:35:08 <ais523> and the company making it got mad
2020-10-09 01:35:25 <ais523> so there was demand for a replacement VCS in a hurry
2020-10-09 01:35:31 <b_jonas> because he wasn't satisifed with the existing tools
2020-10-09 01:35:43 <b_jonas> yeah
2020-10-09 01:35:45 <ais523> not so much "wasn't satisfied" as "was suddenly banned from using"
2020-10-09 01:35:57 <ais523> although, git is better for the Linux kernel than Perforce anyway
2020-10-09 01:36:13 <b_jonas> ais523: yeah
2020-10-09 01:36:22 <ais523> in fact, Perforce's manufacturers probably rather shot themselves in the foot, by inspiring the creation of a free competitor that has outcompeted them quite badly
2020-10-09 01:36:41 <fizzie> Linux was using BitKeeper, not Perforce.
2020-10-09 01:37:08 <b_jonas> ais523: no, they might be laughing at us that they can point to how bad git is and they're offering an alternative to common people that is more down to earth
2020-10-09 01:37:21 <ais523> fizzie: ah, OK
2020-10-09 01:38:19 Quit: Arcorann (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
2020-10-09 01:42:59 <ais523> huh, apparently BitKeeper ended up as open source
2020-10-09 01:43:50 <ais523> I was wondering what happened to it after the debalce in question
2020-10-09 01:44:15 <b_jonas> different topic. in Spelunky 2, shopkeepers usually have a skeleton key that you can get if you kill them. skeleton keys are reusable and can open any doors that silver keys can open. this makes absolutely no sense in-game, and I think it comes from nethack. in nethack it makes some sort of sense, because it wants shopkeepers to be able to open locked doors.
2020-10-09 01:44:46 <b_jonas> and I don't think this is a D&D heritage
2020-10-09 01:45:13 <ais523> there's a spelunky 2?
2020-10-09 01:45:16 <b_jonas> yes
2020-10-09 01:45:18 <b_jonas> it was released recently
2020-10-09 01:45:33 <b_jonas> for Playstation and Windows Steam
2020-10-09 01:46:11 <b_jonas> a nice game, very faithful to Spelunky HD, from its creator, a worthy sequel and good game
2020-10-09 01:46:33 <fizzie> I saw someone on the Internet play Spelunky 2 just recently, and wondered about that.
2020-10-09 01:46:47 <fizzie> Looked like it had a bit more branching in the sequence of levels or something.
2020-10-09 01:46:50 <b_jonas> I've seen much of it on twitch. I'm thoroughly spoiled of the known stuff now.
2020-10-09 01:47:11 <b_jonas> fizzie: yes, zone 2 and zone 4 has two alternative biomes that you choose by entering one of the two exits of the last level of the previous zone
2020-10-09 01:47:40 <b_jonas> zone 2 is either jungle or volcano, zone 4 is either egypt-themed or water + east asia themed
2020-10-09 01:49:40 <b_jonas> and there are also optional boss levels that you enter to via secret levels, an optional 7th zone, and SPOILER an optional "infinite" hard postgame area that is quite hard to enter because you need to get there specific artifacts from three zones (in the intended route; you can actually skip one of them but it's harder)
2020-10-09 01:50:04 <b_jonas> well, four specific artifacts, but one you probably alwyas get anyway
2020-10-09 01:50:14 <b_jonas> the other three only has this one use
2020-10-09 01:50:30 <b_jonas> well, it's more complicated
2020-10-09 01:50:55 <b_jonas> it's one artifact that lets you into the optional 7th zone, and two that together let you from there to the postgame area
2020-10-09 01:51:05 <b_jonas> it's a pretty nice design
2020-10-09 01:51:25 <b_jonas> and there are probably some secrets still not discovered, because the game and especially the Windows release is quite new
2020-10-09 01:51:51 <b_jonas> even besides this zone stuff, the overall gameplay and movement seems really well thought out, except for one specific common item that many people hate
2020-10-09 01:52:42 <b_jonas> I should probably write a summary of the worlds at some point
2020-10-09 01:52:48 <b_jonas> mostly to me to understand it
2020-10-09 01:52:54 <b_jonas> because it's a pretty nice design
2020-10-09 01:53:20 <ais523> it seems surprisingly similar to Spelunky HD, more of an expansion pack than anything
2020-10-09 01:53:28 <ais523> perhaps it's a good thing that people release those as new versions, though
2020-10-09 01:53:29 <b_jonas> with like eleven different biomes (set of map tiles and enemies)
2020-10-09 01:53:41 <ais523> the old-fashioned way of doing games has been mostly abandoned nowadays
2020-10-09 01:53:59 <b_jonas> ais523: it's a new game, but very heavily appeals to the fans of Spelunky HD, so much that good Spelunky players can learn it much easier, because the movement and controls are very similar
2020-10-09 01:54:23 <b_jonas> and many elements are taken from HD too, like many enemies and items and world themes
2020-10-09 01:55:29 <ais523> I've played the original (not HD) but I'm not all that good at it
2020-10-09 01:55:40 <ais523> I feel like I'd enjoy it more if it were turn-based, even though it's a platformer
2020-10-09 01:56:04 <b_jonas> ais523: think of classic game series like Age of Empires, Warcraft, Settlers. new games, but the good parts of design taken, so easier to learn if you know the previous game.
2020-10-09 01:56:26 <ais523> b_jonas: yes, it's a very old-fashioned way to do a game sequel
2020-10-09 01:56:36 <b_jonas> I guess
2020-10-09 01:56:41 <ais523> nowadays that sort of thing's normally done as DLC rather than a sequel

2020-10-09 02:06:44 <b_jonas> ais523: dunno, to me the contrast is more like that nowadays games are short-lived and gimmicky, they want to sell a new idea that people find fun for a year or two, or for six years in case of the most successful games, but then put away and stop playing, and the manufacturer stops pretending to care about it; old games tried to make a good stable base that you can play for a much longer time, and if
2020-10-09 02:06:50 <b_jonas> they succeed, the game becomes a classic that only needs a few tweaks.
2020-10-09 02:07:13 <zzo38> Well, many computer games made these days are not as good as before (although there are exceptions).
2020-10-09 02:07:40 <b_jonas> but maybe this is entirely just a false nostalgic view, obviously I don't know about games released in the last two years that have become classics and people have been playing them for decades,
2020-10-09 02:08:01 <b_jonas> and I don't think so much about all the throwaway old games, only the ones that succeeded to become classics.
2020-10-09 02:09:17 <b_jonas> it is quite possible that Super Mario Odyssey will become one of these classics, and it will be speedran even 15 years from now, together with SM64 and Sunshine
2020-10-09 02:09:43 <ais523> zzo38: there were many bad games before, too, but people don't remember them as well
2020-10-09 02:09:45 <b_jonas> (whereas Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which some people hastily declared the best game ever, will be forgotten)
2020-10-09 02:09:52 <b_jonas> ais523: yeah.
2020-10-09 02:10:28 <zzo38> ais523: Yes, that is true. (And it happens with other works too.)
2020-10-09 02:13:50 <b_jonas> oh by the way, it turns out that the IBM Selectric 1 and 2 really exist, my conspiracy theory that it's war propaganda (or practical joke) spread by Americans about how advanced seemingly impossible technology they had so long ago is false
2020-10-09 02:15:02 <b_jonas> it's weird how many old writings mention these typewriters, but there are so few first-hand observations from contactible people who used the machines back when they were new, and so few remaining examinable copies
2020-10-09 02:17:29 <b_jonas> I still don't understand how a mechanical typewriter with a single electric motor and no electronics can move that crazy ball-shaped head; how it isn't unusable because the glyphs adjacent on the head to the one you want to stamp leave faint marks; how it has a pure mechnical full lockout mechanism so you can't press two keys at the same time; and how it doesn't even attempt to lay the glyphs on the
2020-10-09 02:17:35 <b_jonas> ball out in such a way that the widest glyphs are close to the equator
2020-10-09 02:18:04 <b_jonas> so even though it almost certainly exists, to me it's similar to washing machines, it exists but it's supposed to be impossible
2020-10-09 02:20:49 <b_jonas> but the last straw against the conspiracy theory is https://www.marklin-users.net/cookee_nz/hobbies/IBM/IBMSelectricAPM-Nov1980.pdf , too detailed, I don't believe it could be faked for a conspiracy
2020-10-09 02:21:15 <b_jonas> some of the details mentioned might be misremembered, but overall they're real typewriters
2020-10-09 02:25:09 <zzo38> I have seen that some features of Pokemon games are not as good as the previous games. While I agree, this is not specific to Pokemon and occurs with a lot of series.

2020-10-09 02:31:07 <ais523> b_jonas: huh, do you not believe in washing machines?
2020-10-09 02:33:59 <b_jonas> ais523: I do believe in washing machines, but they're magical, I don't see how they can have the practical effectiveness and reliability that they have as measured by practice, given that we basically know what they have (modulo some secrets that the manufacturers have about recent innovations)
2020-10-09 02:34:32 <b_jonas> zzo38: do you mean the mainline games like Sword/Shield, or side products like Pokemon Let's Go or Pokemon Go
2020-10-09 02:35:21 <b_jonas> ais523: I use a washing machine and commercial washing detergents, and I'm glad that they work so well (admittedly there's some luck here in that I have a model that works well), but I don't understand why they work so well
2020-10-09 02:35:30 <zzo38> b_jonas: I mean the mainline games; the side products are not separate.
2020-10-09 02:37:07 <ais523> I think the best Pokémon games for replay value are HGSS and B2W2, and BW are best if you are planning to only play through once
2020-10-09 02:37:26 <ais523> by replay value I mostly mean grinding the postgame, rather than playing multiple times
2020-10-09 02:38:28 <zzo38> (Also some games will improve some things, and make others worse.)
2020-10-09 02:39:01 <ais523> yes, I think actually every Pokémon game does this
2020-10-09 02:39:21 <ais523> it doesn't help that through much of the series' lifetime, Game Freak would create two Pokémon games in parallel
2020-10-09 02:39:41 <ais523> so it was typically the case that a new feature in one game would disappear in the next, and might then reappear in the game after
2020-10-09 02:45:37 <zzo38> Yes, that it is.
2020-10-09 02:46:13 <zzo38> (A lot of computer games are just made too easy. That happens with everything though, and often they do not even add a difficulty selection menu. However, there are self-imposed challenges, at least.)
2020-10-09 02:48:12 <ais523> it is much more common for computer games to be too easy than too hard
2020-10-09 02:48:23 <zzo38> Yes, it is.
2020-10-09 02:55:22 <int-e> do you ever get a game that starts out very easy and then transitions to nearly impossible with no discernable ramp inbetween?
2020-10-09 02:55:28 <int-e> or is that just happening to me
2020-10-09 02:55:54 <int-e> (don't have a concrete example right now I'm afraid)
2020-10-09 02:56:41 <zzo38> I do not have a example either
2020-10-09 02:58:56 <zzo38> But perhaps see https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Difficulty_Spike
2020-10-09 03:12:47 <ais523> there are some games which don't have consistent internal mechanics, they're just a case of "guess what the devs are thinking"
2020-10-09 03:12:59 <ais523> those can have a ramp like that for some players but not others, when they fail to guess

2020-10-09 09:43:50 <delta23> all the freemasonry conspiracy theories of today are based on an ancient troll from 200 years ago
2020-10-09 09:44:13 <delta23> well, moreso ~125 years ago
2020-10-09 09:44:18 <b_jonas> arseniiv: of course it has roots! Gene Ray doesn't seem to admit it, but he took the idea of the square earth straight from the Bible, as Roger M. Wilcox explains in http://www.rogermwilcox.com/square_earth.html
2020-10-09 09:44:39 <delta23> ah, wrong channel
2020-10-09 09:44:40 <delta23> sorry
2020-10-09 09:45:05 <arseniiv> lol
2020-10-09 09:45:49 <b_jonas> hehe, this came out well. arseniiv talks about the roots of Time Cube, then delta23 starts to talk about ancient freemason trolls
2020-10-09 09:47:40 <delta23> noo :(
2020-10-09 09:50:30 <arseniiv> this is not a coincidence
2020-10-09 09:54:22 <arseniiv> that square-earthiness proof is more or less neat but what if the true metric is non-euclidean: then square-nonsquare dichotomy is a bit different and there are also four natural corners, null corners (or four natural side midpoints). In fact Earth then can be the â€œcircleâ€ with four corners
2020-10-09 09:55:15 <arseniiv> or two glued circles. still with four corners
2020-10-09 09:56:01 <arseniiv> we shall leave this revelation private to this channel
2020-10-09 09:56:50 <b_jonas> By the way, have you noticed what a troll the First Council of Nicaea was about the date of Easter? It was well known that Christ was crucified on Pesach and resurrected two days after, and the Council agreed with this.
2020-10-09 09:56:57 <b_jonas> We need an agreed upon univeral method for when to celebrate the crucifiction and the resurrection, so that corrupt local clergy can't be bribed as for what the date is, as was usual in those times. So do we celebrate it on Pesach? No, that would be too simple.
2020-10-09 09:57:30 <b_jonas> Invent a completely different rule that's just as hard to implement in practice as the version of the Hebrew calendar used back then, that puts Easter vaguely at the same season as Pesach, and would later be forked to like three or four different modern methods for Easter date in schisms. Now we have two problems.

2020-10-09 10:01:54 <Arcorann> All the Council of Nicaea decided for certain is that Christians should celebrate Easter on the same day independently of the Hebrew calendar, if I remember correctly
2020-10-09 10:02:30 <delta23> which calendar?
2020-10-09 10:02:47 <delta23> some of the early christians believed in the book of enoch (c. Jude)
2020-10-09 10:02:54 <Arcorann> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_controversy <-- this covers most of it but there's nothing about the Gregorian calendar for some reason
2020-10-09 10:02:58 <delta23> we need to convert to enoch cal next lol
2020-10-09 10:03:05 <b_jonas> Not that it's ever easy to make a good calendar if it must be tied to both Earth days and (at least one of moon phases or seasons), because if you try to make a mathematically deterministic version, you'll run into problems in a few tens of thousand years just because we can't predict Earth's rotation well enough.
2020-10-09 10:03:21 <delta23> b_jonas: enoch cal had that problem
2020-10-09 10:03:41 <b_jonas> Arcorann_: then who started the habit of Easter always being on Sunday, when Pesach can fall on any of four days of the week?
2020-10-09 10:04:56 <Arcorann> The "final" Julian calendar Easter computations originated in Alexandria, and according to that WP page the Syriac Christians also celebrated on a Sunday
2020-10-09 10:05:05 <b_jonas> basically both the hebrew calendar and the roman calendar stared as being tied to the actual astronomical stuff, then later they adopted possibly short-sighted mathematically defined methods, just so the calendars can be predicted infinitely far, and they don't care if it will be out of sync with astronomy in a few ten thousand years (or in the case of the Julian calendar, in just a thousand years)
2020-10-09 10:05:33 <Arcorann> Roman was never tied to astronomical stuff, pre-Julian it was always ad-hoc
2020-10-09 10:06:09 <b_jonas> Arcorann_: the Romans did tie it to days and seasons, loosely. it wasn't well-defined enough to follow any rule, like I said about corrupt local clergy.
2020-10-09 10:06:22 <b_jonas> Perhaps we should admit why a mathematically deterministic methods can't work for the long term, and not pretend that it's the one deterministic method that will work forever,
2020-10-09 10:07:14 <delta23> make a virtual world which runs on a deterministic calendar
2020-10-09 10:07:35 <Arcorann> I've found a couple of people who tried to match leap years to the tropical year by ridiculously long leap cycles, like millions of years
2020-10-09 10:07:36 <b_jonas> but instead make the calendar depend on astronomical observations, but no on such a short term as the traditional Hebrew calendar, but predictable for a few thousand years into the future, which would have been good enough for messengers from a central Astronomical authority to get around even in Roman times
2020-10-09 10:08:13 <Arcorann> Like the Iranian calendar?
2020-10-09 10:08:14 <b_jonas> admittedly computers and atomic clocks and GPS make it easier, but it's not like the principle was impossible two hundred years ago
2020-10-09 10:08:45 <b_jonas> Arcorann_: yes, and those attempts can't work, because we can't predict how long days will last accurately enough
2020-10-09 10:09:25 <b_jonas> they're misguided toys designed by mathematically inclined people who don't understand the astronomical background
2020-10-09 10:09:35 <Arcorann> Agreed
2020-10-09 10:09:44 <b_jonas> whereas what I say is misguided for political and societal reasons, not for astronomical reasons
2020-10-09 10:10:09 <b_jonas> bb in a few hours
2020-10-09 10:10:15 <Arcorann> The people who designed the French Republican calendar wanted the year to start on the equinox, but then they found that one equinox was predicted to be 20 seconds before midnight with an error margin in the tens of minutes
2020-10-09 10:10:55 <Arcorann> Year 144 of the Republican calendar
2020-10-09 10:16:48 <delta23> make a calendar w/ 10 days in a week
2020-10-09 10:16:51 <delta23> 10 weeks per month
2020-10-09 10:16:54 <delta23> 10 months per year
2020-10-09 10:16:57 <delta23> etc.
2020-10-09 10:17:53 <Arcorann> Someone's probably done that already
2020-10-09 10:18:37 <Arcorann> It was Donald Knuth --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potrzebie#System_of_measurement

2020-10-09 11:14:46 <wib_jonas> Arcorann_: we only had atomic clocks for fifty years. anything we know about how the length of the day changed before that are lucky accidents, where some ancient civilization left records of astronomical observations of the year, month, eclipses, Venus phases, and these are usable only in the rare case when we can clearly determine how many days

2020-10-09 11:40:37 <Arcorann> wib_jonas: https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/417/4/2714/1095659 <-- if you want a laugh
2020-10-09 11:42:58 <wib_jonas> Arcorann_: sorry, that's not the sort of topic I can really laugh about, even if I can see the parody. It's more like sad that we got there.
2020-10-09 11:43:30 <Arcorann> Oh well
2020-10-09 11:44:03 <wib_jonas> I personally am selling my skills of solving problems the traditional way, by translating common sense rules to a computer program, rather than trying to use machine learning to divine rules from examples.
2020-10-09 11:44:53 <wib_jonas> And I find the hype of trying to apply machine learning (and before that, GPU computations, and before that, multithreading, and before that, just in time compiling) even in cases when it makes the problems harder rather sad.
2020-10-09 11:46:15 <wib_jonas> I try to learn enough about all those hyped methods to know when they're useful and when you should ask an expert in those topics, which is a lucky case because they're a dime a dozen now, with every college course trying to teach those fashionable topics only and getting rid of more useful research departments that try to make publications without
2020-10-09 11:46:16 <wib_jonas> adding today's marketing keywords.
2020-10-09 11:46:34 <Arcorann> https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2016.0404 <-- anyway, here's the paper I mentioned earlier
2020-10-09 11:47:39 <wib_jonas> So instead I just understand enough of both mathematics and programming, but only the basics of both, and this combination is apparently rare enough to be worth something as a job skill, despite that it's a natural pairing.

2020-10-09 12:03:32 <wib_jonas> then of course http://www.madore.org/~david/misc/calendar.html because I can't have a discussion without pointint out that David Madore already wrote a long writeup about it
2020-10-09 12:04:00 <wib_jonas> Arcorann_: no, I don't think I recall that one, thanks for the link
2020-10-09 12:04:53 <wib_jonas> Hmm, wasn't there something from David Madore about the hebrew calendar too?

2020-10-09 12:05:34 <Arcorann> Wait, that page doesn't really cover Hebrew
2020-10-09 12:07:44 <wib_jonas> nope, it doesn't look like he wrote anything comprehensive about it, he only mentions it in passing a few times, calling it the Jewish Calendar
