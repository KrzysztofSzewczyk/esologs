2019-10-08 00:38:02 <ais523> <Hooloovo0> the problem is that it used flow control pins as data pins... which if you have a real serial port, that's fine ‚Üê if you're doing that, it isn't a serial port, it's a parallel port
2019-10-08 00:40:32 <kmc> ais523_: well, except that the actual TI protocol is serial, isn't it
2019-10-08 00:40:34 <kmc> clock + data?
2019-10-08 00:41:04 <ais523> I guess you could use the flow control pins as data pins, but not the actual data pins, but that seems perverse
2019-10-08 00:41:22 <ais523> if you're using two different pins to send data simultaneously, though, it isn't a serial connection by definition :-)
2019-10-08 00:41:38 <imode> bits go one at a time down a single wire.
2019-10-08 00:41:46 <kmc> so it's using a "serial port" (as in 8250 compatible UART on a PC) in the common manner of a parallel port (GPIO bitbang) to implement a serial protocol :P
2019-10-08 00:42:09 <kmc> ais523_: SPI is clock + bidirectional data, 3 pins (4 including a chip select) and that's universally considered serial
2019-10-08 00:42:39 <kmc> Hooloovo0: btw the PIClink here seems to be an example of what I was saying re: programming a micro to act like a grey link http://merthsoft.com/linkguide/cable.html
2019-10-08 00:44:29 <kmc> anyway i'm not clear on what the hardware level link protocol is
2019-10-08 00:44:44 <fizzie> The TI link protocol is pretty special.
2019-10-08 00:44:50 <fizzie> It's an async thing.
2019-10-08 00:46:24 <fizzie> When you want to send a bit, you pull one wire to zero, and the receiving end acknowledges by pulling the other wire to zero.
2019-10-08 00:46:36 <fizzie> Which wire you pull determines if it was a 0 or a 1 bit.
2019-10-08 00:46:51 <fizzie> So there's no clock involved, it runs at whatever speed it runs.
2019-10-08 00:47:11 <fizzie> Disclaimer: all I know about this probably came from http://paperlined.org/EE/microcontrollers/pic/projects/portable_VT_terminal/ti_86_link_port/link86all.htm -- at least that page looks familiar.
2019-10-08 00:47:35 <ais523> <kmc> ais523_: SPI is clock + bidirectional data, 3 pins (4 including a chip select) and that's universally considered serial ‚Üê sorry, should have added "in the same direction" to that
2019-10-08 00:47:55 <kmc> fizzie: huh, weird.
2019-10-08 00:48:09 <kmc> cool, this has the info I was looking for
2019-10-08 00:48:36 <fizzie> kmc: Well, it does let you do it all in software on CPUs that might run at rather uncontrolled speeds, without having to have an UART or whatnot.
2019-10-08 00:51:03 <kmc> yeah
2019-10-08 00:51:07 <ais523> hmm, that's an interesting way to fit the normal three wires that an async connection uses (data + strobe + ack) into two, although they both have to be drivable from both ends
2019-10-08 00:51:07 <kmc> it seems pretty clever
2019-10-08 00:51:18 <kmc> it also allows you to immediately tell if the other side is present
2019-10-08 00:51:50 <ais523> I assume that after sending a bit, then the sender undoes their pull, then the recipient undoes their pull, to keep the connection as delay-insensitive
2019-10-08 00:52:12 <kmc> so i would say this is still serial because it transfers one bit of information at a time, even though it uses two wires to do it
2019-10-08 00:52:17 * kmc shrugs
2019-10-08 00:52:35 <kmc> and yeah, it seems this allows the receiving end to slow down the sender when necessary
2019-10-08 00:52:55 <kmc> effectively negotiating a baud rate which is the slower of what the two sides want
2019-10-08 00:52:59 <kmc> it's actually very clever
2019-10-08 00:53:07 <kmc> I might even use this sometime in one of my own projects
2019-10-08 00:53:25 <kmc> I have used Manchester code for something
2019-10-08 00:53:54 <ais523> throughout my PhD I was working on a compiler to hardware which uses a delay-insensitive representation internally for most of the compilation process
2019-10-08 00:54:05 <kmc> which is synchronous, so the bit times have to be roughly the same, but it has clock recovery so no precise absolute frequency reference is required
2019-10-08 00:54:12 <ais523> (for much the same reason that compilers to software use SSA or similar normal forms; you don't want to care about timing details until the compilation is finished)
2019-10-08 00:54:17 <kmc> makes sense
2019-10-08 00:54:32 <ais523> so I ended up doing a lot of background reading on asynchronous circuitry
2019-10-08 00:55:08 <imode> there's a "bible" for asynchronous circuit design.
2019-10-08 00:55:09 <ais523> you nearly always need a separate wire for 0 bits and for 1 bits because you assume that the recipient can't tell which of two wires changed first
2019-10-08 00:55:26 <ais523> but normally, the acknowledgement would be on a third wire
2019-10-08 00:55:27 <imode> asynchronous pipelines are neat. I built one.
2019-10-08 00:55:54 <ais523> a big advantage of doing things that way is that you don't need to reset the logic levels after sending a bit, you just toggle the 0 wire or the 1 wire to send the bit
2019-10-08 00:56:01 <ais523> and the recipient toggles the ack wire to acknowledge
2019-10-08 00:56:23 <kmc> this also reminds me of CAN a bit
2019-10-08 00:56:25 <imode> https://hatebin.com/huuywfgrqq save this as "pipeline.circ" and open it in http://www.cburch.com/logisim/
2019-10-08 00:56:25 <ais523> imode: is this the famous "micropipelines" paper?
2019-10-08 00:56:32 <kmc> it's open-collector and it has clock stretching sort of
2019-10-08 00:56:40 <imode> ais523_: sutherland? partially. there was a larger book.
2019-10-08 00:56:48 <ais523> the funny thing is, one of the references in that paper is dubious, and people keep copying it into their own reference lists without actually chasing the reference
2019-10-08 00:57:01 <imode> http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/edoc_download.php/855/pdf/imm855.pdf this thing.
2019-10-08 00:57:04 <ais523> meaning that you have this book that's highly cited but almost nobody has actually read
2019-10-08 00:57:17 <imode> not surprised.
2019-10-08 00:57:51 <ais523> (the book was basically just being used as a surrogate source for a particular statement because the original source would have been very hard to get hold of at the time; however, the original source for the statement has since been digitised so it's much easier to find)
2019-10-08 00:58:35 <ais523> (and it's basically just a throwaway line in the book, rather than giving any additional context)

2019-10-08 01:25:35 <ais523> programming isn't limited to software
2019-10-08 01:26:12 <ais523> although, the hardware meaning of "programming" normally means "to copy a program to" (where the program is usually software, but could be firmware or even a blueprint for making hardware)

2019-10-08 02:06:24 <ais523> hmm, so I guess "esoteric programming" in hardware would be updating the state of reconfigurable hardware via some ridiculous mechanism

2019-10-08 11:00:16 <myname> where to start
2019-10-08 11:00:37 <int-e> hmm
2019-10-08 11:01:49 <int-e> I guess esowiki is at risk?
2019-10-08 11:02:16 <int-e> not sure about the rest, they usually just react and are not too repetetive.
2019-10-08 11:02:30 <int-e> tricky.
2019-10-08 11:02:37 <fizzie> Well, depends on what you ask them to do.
2019-10-08 11:03:25 <fizzie> zemhill_* can also repeat the same message over and over again, if someone's submitting stuff on the webs. Hmm.
2019-10-08 11:05:30 <int-e> I'm kind of curious how this will/would play out.
2019-10-08 11:07:20 <myname> it is not that uncommon that people ask the same trigger repeatedly, but i guess, that shouldn't be too often
2019-10-08 11:11:16 <fizzie> Maybe I should talk to a staffer anyway.
2019-10-08 11:11:44 <fizzie> Also, maybe I should register an account for HackEso.

2019-10-08 11:13:26 <wib_jonas> Is there a doc for that bot? It doesn't mention one in Taxonomy
2019-10-08 11:14:10 <fizzie> I found relatively little information about it by Googling.
2019-10-08 11:17:19 <wib_jonas> it has a freenode/* cloak though, let me ask #freenode
2019-10-08 11:21:55 <wib_jonas> fizzie: "<Fuchs> wib_jonas: the bot k-lines (and kills, in addition) on various triggers, most famously people repeating patterns"
2019-10-08 11:22:01 <wib_jonas> "<Fuchs> so it most certainly does have side effects, and if the channel has official bots that could look a bit spammy, we should be informed so we can whitelist them before putting sigyn in the channel"
2019-10-08 11:22:17 <wib_jonas> fizzie: go to #freenode and talk to ops there
2019-10-08 11:22:22 <myname> ah, good old fuchs
2019-10-08 11:22:37 <wib_jonas> fizzie: also, they admit that is ran by freenode
2019-10-08 11:23:40 <fizzie> Yeah, I'm trying to get an account for HackEso and esowiki because I assume that'd be useful for whitelisting.
2019-10-08 11:24:08 <int-e> fizzie: now I'm feeling bad for causing you work :/
2019-10-08 11:24:16 <fizzie> (I think I'm just going to need to connect as them temporarily, since I don't think either has a great way of injecting raw text.)
2019-10-08 11:25:45 <int-e> yeah at the very least you'll have to acquire the nick somehow
2019-10-08 11:26:21 <int-e> but they also have to learn to register with nickserv on startup.
2019-10-08 11:26:42 <int-e> well, authenticate
2019-10-08 11:26:55 <fizzie> There's the password approach, I think both of them can do that.

2019-10-08 11:29:53 <fizzie> Hm, well, I don't think multibot actually does passwords. I'll hack that in.
2019-10-08 11:30:52 <wib_jonas> fizzie: there are at least three ways to log in: (1) with PASSWD, (2) with NICKSERV ID , (3) with the CTCP extension. I can send details if you want later about how the CTCP thing works.
2019-10-08 11:31:10 <wib_jonas> each one sends password as cleartext, but that can be inside an ssl/tls connection in either case
2019-10-08 11:32:25 <fizzie> I think that should maybe do it.

2019-10-08 11:32:48 <fizzie> Yes, that seems to have worked.
2019-10-08 11:33:01 <wib_jonas> I have old source code that implemented the CTCP login and worked at one point, though for freenode only and errors out on any other network
2019-10-08 11:33:35 <wib_jonas> HackEso is logged into nickserv as HackEso, or so the server claims
2019-10-08 11:34:06 <wib_jonas> we may have to part j-bot though
2019-10-08 11:34:16 <int-e> wib_jonas: I've heard about SASL... but CTCP?
2019-10-08 11:34:28 <wib_jonas> int-e: sorry, it's SASL
2019-10-08 11:34:37 <wib_jonas> I'm talking off the top of my head because I'm a towkr
2019-10-08 11:34:42 <wib_jonas> CTCP is an unrelated thing
2019-10-08 11:35:01 <wib_jonas> it's SASL, which has so many S and L in its name that you'd think it uses some cryptographic challenge, but it doesn't
2019-10-08 11:35:08 <wib_jonas> rather confusing name
2019-10-08 11:35:15 <int-e> Okay. CTCP is just a special kind of PRIVMSG so it seemed out of place.
2019-10-08 11:35:22 <wib_jonas> it just encodes the account name and password in base64
2019-10-08 11:35:23 <fizzie> Well, it can, right? There are SASL methods that involve crypto.
2019-10-08 11:35:30 * int-e uses CTCP all the time!
2019-10-08 11:35:31 <wib_jonas> FireFly: ping
2019-10-08 11:35:47 <fizzie> Anyway, I think I'm fine with a TLS connection + PASS on connect.
2019-10-08 11:36:15 <fizzie> (The bouncer I use for myself + for fungot does SASL.)
2019-10-08 11:36:15 <fungot> fizzie: keep in mind, but i'm sure you can
2019-10-08 11:36:25 <wib_jonas> FireFly: are you running j-bot? fizzie has invited Sigyn to #freenode . it's a bot ran by freenode that k-lines users who spam the channel

2019-10-08 11:37:00 <wib_jonas> FireFly: you might need to be either careful so that j-bot doesn't trigger it, or get the channel ops to ask an exception for it, or just part j-bot from this channel while we have this state
2019-10-08 11:37:19 <wib_jonas> I apologize, because I was the one who asked to get j-bot here, knowing that it can be spammy
2019-10-08 11:37:37 <wib_jonas> ah yes, it may be called PASS rather than PASSWD
2019-10-08 11:37:48 <wib_jonas> funny they abbreviate that command name, but not PRIVMSG
2019-10-08 11:39:30 <FireFly> oh
2019-10-08 11:39:32 <FireFly> hmmm
2019-10-08 11:39:52 <FireFly> I think it should be fine, I'll check later

2019-10-08 11:42:21 <fungot> fizzie: in fnord it only runs where ghc runs :)

2019-10-08 11:43:42 <wib_jonas> fizzie: and you mentioned zemhill_________ too
2019-10-08 11:44:14 <fizzie> Yes, I just don't want to touch that at this point. It's used very very little.
2019-10-08 11:44:19 <wib_jonas> yeah
2019-10-08 11:44:37 <wib_jonas> probably for the best
2019-10-08 11:45:43 <fizzie> So what's the normal rule for talking to Freenode ops, should I just pick a random one on the list or ask on the channel?
2019-10-08 11:47:12 <wib_jonas> fizzie: in this case, ask Fuchs on #freenode what to do since he already answered a question
2019-10-08 11:47:38 <wib_jonas> if it's not a secret thing, then asking on #freenode is the normal way
2019-10-08 11:47:43 <fizzie> Right.
2019-10-08 11:47:53 <wib_jonas> but some operatorial things shouldn't be public, in which case you have to privmsg them
2019-10-08 11:48:05 <wib_jonas> like, if you want to mention specific details about the spammer
2019-10-08 11:48:18 <int-e> Though the way #freenode is currently set up only staffers will see the messages anyway, I guess.
2019-10-08 11:48:38 <int-e> (But their answers will be visible to all.)
2019-10-08 11:48:44 <fizzie> Oh, that's interesting.
2019-10-08 11:48:49 <wib_jonas> int-e: no, it's not on +mz right now
2019-10-08 11:48:54 <int-e> Huh, that's false...
2019-10-08 11:49:05 <wib_jonas> they do often switch it to +mz
2019-10-08 11:49:06 <int-e> wib_jonas: Funny though I didn't see your question? Let me check again.
2019-10-08 11:49:12 <int-e> wib_jonas: Or did you ask before I joined?
2019-10-08 11:49:15 <fizzie> Right, it's that moderation thing.
2019-10-08 11:49:20 <wib_jonas> int-e: what question?
2019-10-08 11:49:32 <wib_jonas> question for what?
2019-10-08 11:49:43 <int-e> wib_jonas: You asked about Sigyn on #freenode.
2019-10-08 11:50:15 <int-e> wib_jonas: I joined around 12:58, I saw the answer around 13:19... I didn't see your question.
2019-10-08 11:50:58 <int-e> But it didn't occur to me that it may have taken longer than 20 minutes to get it... hence my question here, now.
2019-10-08 11:54:20 <wib_jonas> int-e: they have unidentified users quieted
2019-10-08 11:54:30 <wib_jonas> int-e: in the mode #freenode +q $~a
2019-10-08 11:55:00 <int-e> wib_jonas: thanks
2019-10-08 11:55:07 <wib_jonas> there, now I'm identified, you'll see if I say anything on #freenode, but I no longer have a reason to say anything there
2019-10-08 11:56:14 <int-e> I was mystified. I hate being mystified by technology, that's what magic is for :)

2019-10-08 13:34:28 <arseniiv> allocates and deallocates things and doesn‚Äôt say anyone where and why
2019-10-08 13:34:33 <wib_jonas> arseniiv: I think buubot2 had such functionality, but buubot3 doesn't have it, perhaps because it's so easy to abuse

2019-10-08 13:37:11 <wib_jonas> arseniiv: you can try running commands in HackEso/j-bot/lambdabot/fung–æt that take some time to run, like up to ten seconds or whatever the timeout is, then if there's a lot of other chat, perhaps people will miss your command.

2019-10-08 13:37:33 <wib_jonas> arseniiv: it's the easiest with HackEso, since on a timeout, it just prints the output so far with no error message

2019-10-08 13:38:11 <arseniiv> wib_jonas: then if there's a lot of other chat, perhaps people will miss your command. => hmmmmn I have doubts
2019-10-08 13:38:23 <HackEso> No output.
2019-10-08 13:38:28 <wib_jonas> arseniiv: HackEso is also pretty programmable, so you can make it give surprising results that seem unconnected to your query

2019-10-08 13:39:19 <fungot> arseniiv: is that not many people have understanding the concept. on fnord, and so
2019-10-08 13:40:06 <wib_jonas> lambdabot and j-bot support assignments too, so you can just make any variable or function have an unexpected value, and in j-bot, you can even change values from private message if you know the right incantations, but the drawback is that j-bot and lambdabot always mentions the nick of whoever they reply to
2019-10-08 13:40:24 <wib_jonas> no wait
2019-10-08 13:40:28 <wib_jonas> lambdabot doesn't
2019-10-08 13:40:34 <wib_jonas> and you can give assignments in private message
2019-10-08 13:42:06 <wib_jonas> but it's not easy in either j-bot or lambdabot to redefine builtins
2019-10-08 13:42:14 <wib_jonas> eg. it's not easy to make them say that 2+2 is 5
2019-10-08 13:42:16 <wib_jonas> > 2+2
2019-10-08 13:42:18 <lambdabot> 4
2019-10-08 13:42:20 <wib_jonas> [ 2+2
2019-10-08 13:42:21 <j-bot> wib_jonas: 4
2019-10-08 13:42:50 <wib_jonas> if you try to redefine (+), you just get a message about how it's ambiguous with Prelude.(+)
2019-10-08 13:43:44 <wib_jonas> iirc rust works more sanely, because wildcard imports (like how you import every symbol that Prelude exports) can be shadowed by a symbol that is either local to a package or imported by name

2019-10-08 13:53:18 <wib_jonas> there's one way that buubot3 lets you cheat: while it's running the eval command (which evaluates a perl statement) in a sandbox, it's running all of them in the same sandbox, so if more than one buubot command is simultaneously running an eval, than one can kill, or perhaps even ptrace, the other
2019-10-08 13:53:32 <wib_jonas> ptrace may be impossible, but I experimented with killing a lot
2019-10-08 13:54:40 <wib_jonas> fizzie: no! don't add cloaks. they're usually longer than an ordinary hostname, so the max response length that they can give gets shorter
2019-10-08 13:55:02 <wib_jonas> fizzie: or if you do give them cloaks, then make sure to edit the spore or similar commands in HackEso to know about the new max message length

2019-10-08 13:59:04 <myname> wtf does sport do
2019-10-08 13:59:14 <wib_jonas> `? sport
2019-10-08 13:59:16 <HackEso> sport <n> divides its input into irc-sized pieces and displays the nth (default first). The pipe version of `1. See also spore.
2019-10-08 13:59:16 <wib_jonas> `? spore
2019-10-08 13:59:17 <HackEso> spore <n> stores its input in tmp/spout and displays the nth line (default first). For a version considering irc line lengths, see sport. See also `spam.
2019-10-08 13:59:48 <wib_jonas> fizzie: for lambdabot, it probably matters less, because it has a very short message length on channels, and breaks into multiple lines for private messages
2019-10-08 13:59:58 <wib_jonas> but for HackEso this should be changed I think
2019-10-08 14:00:17 <wib_jonas> also now it can look at the IRC_* variables to know how long the target is
2019-10-08 14:01:05 <wib_jonas> also, this is the sort of thing why I don't trust the HackEso scripts and just use coreutils and perl one-liners when using HackEso
2019-10-08 14:01:49 <int-e> lambdabot's fairly conservative about IRC message lengths... I seem to recall 350 characters for privmsg?
2019-10-08 14:02:18 <fizzie> HackEso was tuned for throughput, not reliability.
2019-10-08 14:02:18 <wib_jonas> it gave up after two list entries above, so that should fit
2019-10-08 14:02:34 <fizzie> I'm kind of reluctant to bother them again, after I mentioned the cloaks after the Sigyn whitelisting and they said it would've been nice to have been told about that first.
2019-10-08 14:03:06 <wib_jonas> fizzie: sorry, I didn't know that you'd be applying for cloaks
2019-10-08 14:03:09 <wib_jonas> I would have told otherwise
2019-10-08 14:03:15 <fizzie> Yeah, I should've mentioned.
2019-10-08 14:03:37 <wib_jonas> I never asked cloaks for my bots, because the hostname that they used was shorter than any cloak
2019-10-08 14:03:57 <wib_jonas> that said, you could of course try to register the esolangs community and get shorter cloaks eventually after a year....
2019-10-08 14:04:00 <wib_jonas> nah
2019-10-08 14:04:01 <fizzie> I don't think it's an issue for fungot, since it's got a conservative max length too. And probably not for esowiki either, because it doesn't matter if it truncates long titles a little more.

2019-10-08 14:04:17 <fizzie> For HackEso it's a little unfortunate.
2019-10-08 14:04:32 <fizzie> I remember we changed the username to ~h to get a few extra characters out.
2019-10-08 14:04:48 <wib_jonas> yes. we should golf the channel name too.
2019-10-08 14:05:08 <wib_jonas> sadly iirc freenode doesn't allow non-ascii channel names

2019-10-08 14:32:12 <wib_jonas> `? wisdom.pdf
2019-10-08 14:32:13 <HackEso> Nicely formatted classical wisdoms and quotes book at https://www.dropbox.com/s/fyhqyvy3i8oh25m/wisdom.pdf
2019-10-08 14:41:46 <fizzie> We recently had the occasion to send some PDF files to an official thing, and turns out they were only able to view some of them. Presumably due to some sort of software incompatibility somewhere.
2019-10-08 14:43:20 <fizzie> I couldn't find out any sort of patterns in what worked and what didn't, though. The PDF 1.4 files generated by wkhtmltopdf were fine. The ones that allegedly only showed up as blank were PDF 1.3 and 1.5 files (but why would they support only 1.4 in the middle?), generated by printing from Gimp or with 'pdftk' concatenating from various sources.
2019-10-08 14:43:41 <fizzie> All in all, it was a pretty depressing format.

2019-10-08 14:45:59 <wib_jonas> fizzie: perhaps the default options were changed between those versions because people did debug out what doesn't work and reported which features some official things don't support
2019-10-08 14:46:17 <wib_jonas> you could probably fix it by changing the options, but you don't know what you have to change the options to
2019-10-08 14:46:31 <wib_jonas> fizzie: it wasn't a paper size thing, right?
2019-10-08 14:46:48 <fizzie> Not as far as I can tell, they were all A4 according to pdfinfo.
2019-10-08 14:46:58 <int-e> It's a Pretty Dubious Format too.
2019-10-08 14:48:10 <fizzie> ...well, there are *some* differences in paper size, some are "595.28 x 841.89 pts (A4)" and others "595 x 842 pts (A4)".
2019-10-08 14:48:43 <myname> how do you draw .38 pts?
2019-10-08 14:49:09 <fizzie> I think my current plan is to print all the non-working ones, and send them the PDFs generated by the printer/scanner/copier machine at work, under the assumption that that's been engineered to work as widely as possible.
2019-10-08 14:53:50 <myname> fizzie: you don't support "1.4 in the middle". you support the brand new 1.4 as soon as it comes out, drop support for 1.3 and never update to 1.5 once it shows up
