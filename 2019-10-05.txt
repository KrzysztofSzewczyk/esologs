2019-10-05 00:00:37 <imode> my question is, without this mechanism (which has implications regarding the uniqueness of the generated binding), is it still turing complete?
2019-10-05 00:02:45 <imode> I don't see how it could be. if I treat the tuple store as a set rather than a bag, there's no way to generate unique tuples without explicitly listing them all.
2019-10-05 00:03:30 <imode> if I treat it as a bag, then I could probably construct some sort of counter.
2019-10-05 00:17:38 <zzo38> I wrote this list of ideas for the game; to see if they like or dislike them or can make variants of it to make a more surprise to me. https://arin.ga/JfMezt What is your opinion of this, please? Do you have any further ideas please?
