2019-10-05 00:00:37 <imode> my question is, without this mechanism (which has implications regarding the uniqueness of the generated binding), is it still turing complete?
2019-10-05 00:02:45 <imode> I don't see how it could be. if I treat the tuple store as a set rather than a bag, there's no way to generate unique tuples without explicitly listing them all.
2019-10-05 00:03:30 <imode> if I treat it as a bag, then I could probably construct some sort of counter.
2019-10-05 00:17:38 <zzo38> I wrote this list of ideas for the game; to see if they like or dislike them or can make variants of it to make a more surprise to me. https://arin.ga/JfMezt What is your opinion of this, please? Do you have any further ideas please?

2019-10-05 00:55:25 <Lykaina> i can't make any sense of the irc program i wrote 10+ years ago
2019-10-05 00:55:28 <Lykaina> it's 8 bash shell scripts, uses 100% cpu...
2019-10-05 00:55:31 <Lykaina> all i know
2019-10-05 00:56:50 <zzo38> You should write it to not use 100% CPU.
2019-10-05 00:57:08 <Lykaina> it wasn't intentional
2019-10-05 00:58:08 <zzo38> O, OK
2019-10-05 00:59:32 <zzo38> I use IRC program I wrote by myself. If I were writing it today though I probably would do some things differently, such as not using PHP (I didn't have anything better at that time).
2019-10-05 01:00:42 <Lykaina> no idea how beetle (it's name) works.
2019-10-05 01:04:09 <zzo38> Other than using 100% CPU, is it any good?
2019-10-05 01:04:30 <Lykaina> i remember that it is, in a sense, multiple programs working as one.
2019-10-05 01:04:31 <fizzie> I had an IRC thing (though I think it might've been an ircII script) that used 100% of CPU too, except it was on my ISP's shared shell server and got me shouted at.
2019-10-05 01:04:45 <pikhq> *wince*
2019-10-05 01:05:14 <fizzie> It wasn't a particularly large ISP.
2019-10-05 01:05:26 <fizzie> They got acquired at least three levels deep, eventually.

2019-10-05 01:06:56 <fizzie> Dystopia (the original ISP) got bought up by sci.fi, which merged with a bunch of others to join Saunalahti, which eventually ended up owned by Elisa.
