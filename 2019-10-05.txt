2019-10-05 00:00:37 <imode> my question is, without this mechanism (which has implications regarding the uniqueness of the generated binding), is it still turing complete?
2019-10-05 00:02:45 <imode> I don't see how it could be. if I treat the tuple store as a set rather than a bag, there's no way to generate unique tuples without explicitly listing them all.
2019-10-05 00:03:30 <imode> if I treat it as a bag, then I could probably construct some sort of counter.
2019-10-05 00:17:38 <zzo38> I wrote this list of ideas for the game; to see if they like or dislike them or can make variants of it to make a more surprise to me. https://arin.ga/JfMezt What is your opinion of this, please? Do you have any further ideas please?

2019-10-05 00:55:25 <Lykaina> i can't make any sense of the irc program i wrote 10+ years ago
2019-10-05 00:55:28 <Lykaina> it's 8 bash shell scripts, uses 100% cpu...
2019-10-05 00:55:31 <Lykaina> all i know
2019-10-05 00:56:50 <zzo38> You should write it to not use 100% CPU.
2019-10-05 00:57:08 <Lykaina> it wasn't intentional
2019-10-05 00:58:08 <zzo38> O, OK
2019-10-05 00:59:32 <zzo38> I use IRC program I wrote by myself. If I were writing it today though I probably would do some things differently, such as not using PHP (I didn't have anything better at that time).
2019-10-05 01:00:42 <Lykaina> no idea how beetle (it's name) works.
2019-10-05 01:04:09 <zzo38> Other than using 100% CPU, is it any good?
2019-10-05 01:04:30 <Lykaina> i remember that it is, in a sense, multiple programs working as one.
2019-10-05 01:04:31 <fizzie> I had an IRC thing (though I think it might've been an ircII script) that used 100% of CPU too, except it was on my ISP's shared shell server and got me shouted at.
2019-10-05 01:04:45 <pikhq> *wince*
2019-10-05 01:05:14 <fizzie> It wasn't a particularly large ISP.
2019-10-05 01:05:26 <fizzie> They got acquired at least three levels deep, eventually.

2019-10-05 01:33:45 <shachaf> If you want to define busy-beaver-style numbers in a way people will easily agree on, what computation system should you use?
2019-10-05 01:34:25 <shachaf> The classic one with Turing machines has questions like whether the tape is double-sided, whether blank is a separate symbol, whether you count number of steps or output size, etc.
2019-10-05 01:34:53 <shachaf> What's a sequence that grows as quickly as BB but can be defined unambiguously in one sentence?
2019-10-05 01:35:19 <shachaf> I was thinking maybe somthing about the solution to a Diophantine equation of some size, but then defining the size of an equation is slightly awkward.
2019-10-05 01:35:33 <pikhq> Hmm, tricky. I think the most important property for such a computation system (beyond being TC, of course) is being simple to state unambiguously.
2019-10-05 01:45:22 <kmc> can you define something analogous to busy beaver machines with lambda calculus or combinators?
2019-10-05 01:46:01 <shachaf> Sure.
2019-10-05 01:46:12 <shachaf> You can count the number of reductions or something.
2019-10-05 01:46:14 <kmc> yep
2019-10-05 01:46:29 <shachaf> Or just produce a large number.
2019-10-05 01:46:42 <pikhq> Yeah, I guess a SKI combinator busy beaver makes sense
2019-10-05 01:46:43 <kmc> B(n) = the maximum number of reduction steps to normal form for a combinator string of size n

2019-10-05 01:47:12 <oerjan> even those cases still require you to define the syntax to measure size.
2019-10-05 01:47:43 <kmc> true
2019-10-05 01:47:55 <kmc> but it's just a tree where leaves are labeled S or K, right?
2019-10-05 01:48:06 <kmc> a binary tree
2019-10-05 01:50:52 <oerjan> still more one way to count that :P
2019-10-05 01:50:57 <oerjan> *+than
2019-10-05 01:51:10 <kmc> sure
2019-10-05 01:51:15 <kmc> but it should fit in one sentence
2019-10-05 01:51:21 <kmc> which was the original goal
2019-10-05 01:51:33 <kmc> if you have to define S and K then it'd be a bit of a run-on sentence but whatever

2019-10-05 04:36:52 <Hooloovo0> I've done a bit of meditation
2019-10-05 04:38:23 <Hooloovo0> basically all I've done is go into a hypnagogic state while my brain is still awake, basically lay completely still for a long time
2019-10-05 04:39:51 <Hooloovo0> eventually you should feel an, uh, weight, or numbness, leading down your extremities
2019-10-05 04:42:33 <Hooloovo0> it's weird not having any (changing) sensory input at all...
2019-10-05 04:55:42 <zzo38> How to control the set of characters that pushing control and a arrow key skips to in the location bar in Firefox? I want it to skip to only / & = # ?
2019-10-05 05:00:00 <kmc> Hooloovo0: cool
2019-10-05 05:00:08 <kmc> I'm going to try a sensory deprivation float tank probably next week
2019-10-05 05:00:17 <kmc> and see what that's like
2019-10-05 05:00:47 <Hooloovo0> fun, let me know how that goes
2019-10-05 05:00:59 <kmc> sure thing
2019-10-05 05:02:50 <Hooloovo0> I feel like a sensory deprivation tank would produce the same effects as I get, but I'm not sure if there's anything else I'm not (sensing/feeling/experiencing)

2019-10-05 05:21:23 <kmc> mhm
2019-10-05 05:21:28 <kmc> well, it'll be different for everyone anyway
2019-10-05 05:21:33 <kmc> but I'm glad to share my experiences
2019-10-05 05:21:52 <kmc> I have a longstanding interest in altered mental states.
2019-10-05 05:22:20 <kmc> one semester in college I had 2 roommates so I built the space under my desk into a sensory isolation sleeping pod
2019-10-05 05:22:23 <kmc> it was great
2019-10-05 05:22:38 <kmc> I had a thick piece of wood and blackout curtains that I could slide against the open side
2019-10-05 05:22:55 <kmc> I slept in there, would also watch tv on my laptop, or listen to music in the dark
2019-10-05 05:23:19 <kmc> and i'm also into psychedelic drugs but you know that.
2019-10-05 05:23:31 <kmc> zzo38: have you ever taken psychedelic drugs?
2019-10-05 05:24:02 <kmc> I have tried to meditate a bit, but never made a habit of it; I am much better at forming habits now than I was the last time I tried, so maybe it will stick this time
2019-10-05 05:24:12 <kmc> my therapist recommend going to some events at the SF Zen Center
2019-10-05 05:24:34 <kmc> hynagogic states are interesting
2019-10-05 05:24:42 <kmc> hypnagogic*
2019-10-05 05:24:53 <kmc> as are dreams
2019-10-05 05:25:02 <kmc> I have used galantamine a couple of times to enhance dreaming
2019-10-05 05:25:56 <Hooloovo0> I have never had a real habit of meditating
2019-10-05 05:26:31 <Hooloovo0> it's always been somethting I do once every 2 days - 2 months ish
2019-10-05 05:27:04 <kmc> mm
2019-10-05 05:27:16 <Hooloovo0> I did take a class on buddhism which I thought was really great
2019-10-05 05:27:21 <kmc> cool
2019-10-05 05:29:32 <Hooloovo0> the professor is a monk - he teaches at a monestary/university and I don't know what else to say
2019-10-05 05:30:09 <kmc> cool
2019-10-05 05:30:58 <kmc> another thing i do that is maybe a bit like meditation (or maybe even the opposite) is to listen to music intently in a way that crowds out 'verbal' thoughts
2019-10-05 05:31:03 <kmc> it feels good
2019-10-05 05:32:20 <kmc> at some point in my late teens I gained the ability to follow multiple voices in music in a deeper way than I could before -- in a way that actually feels like multithreaded attention
2019-10-05 05:32:56 <kmc> this happened shortly after I first smoked pot, i don't know if that's related but plausibly
2019-10-05 05:33:04 <Hooloovo0> I feel like "not thinking verbal thoughts" is a distinct state of consciousness different from a lot of others
2019-10-05 05:34:39 <kmc> yeah
2019-10-05 05:34:47 <kmc> and the goal of many forms of meditation is to reach this state?
2019-10-05 05:35:04 <Hooloovo0> it's what you get from listening while high af, and (chanting/dancing/etc) while arguably sober
2019-10-05 05:35:12 <Hooloovo0> yeah
2019-10-05 05:37:24 <kmc> i think drugs usually *don't* help me get there
2019-10-05 05:37:39 <kmc> because i am very analytical and keep trying to describe the drug experience in words (in my own head or to others)
2019-10-05 05:38:31 <kmc> and even if that's not where my attention focuses, i get really analytical on psychedelics
2019-10-05 05:38:35 <kmc> cannabis might be better for it
2019-10-05 05:38:50 <kmc> but yeah I think listening to music intently (whether sober or not) is the best way I know to do it
2019-10-05 05:39:00 <Hooloovo0> that makes sense... when I take drugs, I always think about how it's different from base reality
2019-10-05 05:39:41 <Hooloovo0> I have not tried psychadelics, just weed, so there's that
2019-10-05 05:39:54 <Hooloovo0> well, weed/booze
2019-10-05 05:40:07 <kmc> from this discussion I get the feeling that you would find psychedelics interesting :)
2019-10-05 05:40:36 <Hooloovo0> yes, I think so
2019-10-05 05:40:51 <Hooloovo0> I mean I'm sure theyd be interesting
2019-10-05 05:41:26 <Hooloovo0> I'm not actually sure why I have qualms about taking them
2019-10-05 05:41:41 <Hooloovo0> never had an easy chance to
2019-10-05 05:42:03 <kmc> yeah
2019-10-05 05:43:01 <kmc> good to wait and do it right
2019-10-05 05:43:12 <kmc> because the experience is determined mostly by set&setting and not by the drug itself
2019-10-05 05:43:26 <kmc> stanislav grof called LSD a "nonspecific amplifier of mental processes" or something like that, and I think he's right
2019-10-05 05:43:44 <kmc> I think of it as turning up the gain on all sorts of pattern matching systems
2019-10-05 05:44:25 <kmc> so you start to see things that aren't there, but also things that are real and had eluded you previously
2019-10-05 05:44:33 <kmc> not just in the literal sense of 'see' but also with respect to emotions and cognition
2019-10-05 05:44:42 <kmc> but, it's hard to put it into words of course.
2019-10-05 05:46:57 <Hooloovo0> yeah, see/experience/feel are different
2019-10-05 05:47:20 <kmc> then on the more intense experiences the subject/object boundary itself becomes permeable, or dissolves entirely
2019-10-05 05:47:58 <Hooloovo0> I'm not entirely sure I understand that sentence
2019-10-05 05:48:14 <kmc> which is impossible to describe. anything you say about it is a contradiction because our way of talking is essentially predicated on that distinction
2019-10-05 05:48:27 <kmc> a statement like "I experienced ego death" is obviously contradictory
2019-10-05 05:48:32 <kmc> and yet
2019-10-05 05:48:52 <kmc> ego death is... a thing that happens

2019-10-05 05:48:57 <kmc> it doesn't happen *to* anyone
2019-10-05 05:49:33 <kmc> I was essentially a panpsychist before I started taking psychedelics but it's one thing to believe something and another to experience it, you know?
2019-10-05 05:49:45 <kmc> that there is only one thing, which is you and me and the universe and God and doesn't even need a name
2019-10-05 05:49:57 <kmc> and all the boundaries are heuristics we impose on the world
2019-10-05 05:50:19 <shachaf> When I was a v. small human I remember just naturally thinking that everyone was the same person.
2019-10-05 05:50:31 <shachaf> And being surprised at the realization that maybe that's not true.
2019-10-05 05:50:38 <shachaf> Of course it could be a fake memory like most of my earliest memories.
2019-10-05 05:50:41 <kmc> did you include yourself in that?
2019-10-05 05:50:49 <kmc> how do you know your early memories are fake?
2019-10-05 05:50:51 <shachaf> Yes.
2019-10-05 05:51:14 <Hooloovo0> ++
2019-10-05 05:51:27 <kmc> I don't have a lot of childhood memories. I'm told this is a thing that happens with dissociation
2019-10-05 05:51:30 <kmc> but maybe I have enough
2019-10-05 05:51:33 <shachaf> Some of them I can tell because they match stories that I've been told, but then when I ask about further details it turns out they're wrong (e.g. not in the place I thought).
2019-10-05 05:51:44 <kmc> mm
2019-10-05 05:52:16 <Hooloovo0> I'm not sure what you mean by the me/universe/god statement
2019-10-05 05:52:26 <shachaf> Others I think are fake due to other heuristics but I don't remember the details now.
2019-10-05 05:52:28 <kmc> Hooloovo0: I'm only going to make a fool of myself if I try
2019-10-05 05:52:31 <kmc> that's how these things go
2019-10-05 05:52:52 <kmc> lexande frequently submits corrections to my autobiography
2019-10-05 05:52:54 <Hooloovo0> I know
2019-10-05 05:53:01 <kmc> I think his memory is better than mine overall
2019-10-05 05:55:44 <Hooloovo0> before searching for it again I felt like https://principiadiscordia.com/book/57.php
2019-10-05 05:55:47 <Hooloovo0> might be relevant
2019-10-05 05:55:52 <zzo38> When any player casts a spell, that player may choose a number which is a multiple of the converted mana cost of that spell, is less than or equal to forty, and has not yet been chosen for ~. If they do not, they lose five life.
2019-10-05 05:56:00 <Hooloovo0> re-searching?
2019-10-05 05:57:18 <kmc> Hooloovo0: that is a nice page
2019-10-05 05:57:28 <kmc> I was pretty into discordianism as a teenager
2019-10-05 05:57:34 <kmc> I should probably go back and read the texts again
2019-10-05 05:57:36 <zzo38> Hooloovo0: I read that before, and, I think it is good.
2019-10-05 05:57:49 * Hooloovo0 reads logs: I know was re: (I'll make a fool of myself if I try)
2019-10-05 05:58:01 <kmc> "Pick a grid, and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears disordered. Pick another grid, and the same chaos will appear differently ordered and disordered."
2019-10-05 05:58:07 <kmc> this can be made mathematically precise in quantum mechanics
2019-10-05 05:58:31 <Hooloovo0> that's one of the reasons I like it
2019-10-05 05:58:34 <kmc> you have different basis sets for a hilbert space
2019-10-05 05:58:48 <zzo38> kmc: Yes, I suppose so. I have not considered that, but, yes, that makes sense.
2019-10-05 05:58:49 <kmc> a state that looks entangled in one basis is separated in another
2019-10-05 05:58:58 <kmc> and everything you do in the system is basically a change of basis?
2019-10-05 05:59:20 <shachaf> Wait, does entanglement depend on your basis?
2019-10-05 05:59:21 <zzo38> One book about philosophy that I had read some time ago, mentioned, quoting someone else, they expected you can write a serious book about philosophy consisting entirely of jokes. Now I can think that is correct, because that is what Principia Discordia is.
2019-10-05 05:59:22 <kmc> quantum observation is choosing a basis and then projecting the system state onto it
2019-10-05 05:59:25 <kmc> shachaf: maybe not
2019-10-05 05:59:36 <shachaf> I thought that, like being a rank-1 matrix, separability was basis-independent.
2019-10-05 05:59:55 <kmc> zzo38: that seems about right
2019-10-05 06:00:33 <shachaf> whoa, I had a basic question about quantum things that maybe you know the answer to.
2019-10-05 06:00:47 <kmc> you shouldn't expect me to be correct
2019-10-05 06:00:55 <shachaf> I feel like all the quantum things I know, like entanglement, can be local.
2019-10-05 06:00:57 <kmc> especially in my current state
2019-10-05 06:01:03 <shachaf> But I don't know what locality means.
2019-10-05 06:01:08 <shachaf> What do I do?
2019-10-05 06:02:02 <zzo38> I have looked at the mathematics of quantum state vectors, and it does seem like some states might be entangled or unentangled from some point of view. But, it is confusing and apparently even scientists do not understand so well, so I have heard?
2019-10-05 06:02:22 <Hooloovo0> zzo38, no, the PD is completely serious. there's no jokes in it
2019-10-05 06:02:42 <shachaf> zzo38: I think the specific thing about whether a state is separable or not is just regular multilinear algebra that people do understand?
2019-10-05 06:02:43 * Hooloovo0 goes to get a hot dog
2019-10-05 06:03:27 <zzo38> shachaf: Probably you are correct.
2019-10-05 06:04:51 <zzo38> Hooloovo0: Are you sure there is no jokes in it? I thought it is completely serious despite it consists entirely of jokes.

2019-10-05 08:17:56 <Hooloovo0> I'm interested if it's similar to my own experience or if there's some qualitative differences
2019-10-05 08:18:31 <ski> occasionally, my heart can sometimes start beating heavily, for no discernable reason
2019-10-05 08:19:52 <ski> it can be hard to maintain a relaxed attention thing. not paying particular attention to breathing, to heart, to visual (non-)input, &c.
2019-10-05 08:20:28 <Hooloovo0> yeah, that can happen
2019-10-05 08:20:40 <ski> in some cases, i've layed, thinking about some mathy/logicy/programmingy problem, and after awhile noticed the sensory world has just faded away
2019-10-05 08:21:33 <ski> some times, i've tried counting up (sometimes in hexadecimal) (at a sortof irregular pace), in order to keep mind busy, balancing at sleep's edge
2019-10-05 08:23:40 <ski> occasionally, i've had these weird momentary visual impressions of some kind of scene (i'm pretty sure i didn't accidentally open my eyes), however, disappeared too quickly for me to get any bearings on what's in the scene. i've wondered whether that's a hypnagogic hallucination, but if it is, i suspect it's not the usual kind
2019-10-05 08:24:35 <Hooloovo0> I'm not sure there is a 'usual hypnagogic'
2019-10-05 08:24:39 <ski> (relevant here is perhaps that i don't think i'm a visual thinker, i have a hard time visualizing anything at all. i think maybe i'm thinking "structurally" (in terms of connections ?), perhaps ?)

2019-10-05 08:25:52 <Hooloovo0> I am definitely a visual thinker, so I'm not sure what non-visual hypnagogicity would be like
2019-10-05 08:26:10 <ski> one thing which i'm pondered if it maybe is, is related to WILDs, that i saw someone describe. they'd lay awake, and eventually they'd be "presented" with scenes, which if they "jumped into", they'd become dreams (lucid)
2019-10-05 08:27:10 <Hooloovo0> I have only once or twice had lucid dreams... they were ok, I guess?
2019-10-05 08:28:17 <ski> (occasionally, i've had a sensation (partly controllable) of "mind being curled up like a piece of paper in a roll, tighter and tighter". not quite sure how to express that)

2019-10-05 08:28:51 <shachaf> All sorts of things. But it opens with a discussion of this, I think.
2019-10-05 08:29:07 * ski is bad at remembering dreams. should perhaps try setting the alarm clock one hour earlier some time, again
2019-10-05 08:29:35 <Hooloovo0> I feel like I've had a similar sensation... but I'm not sure
2019-10-05 08:29:47 <Hooloovo0> I was probably not sober at the time

2019-10-05 16:17:22 <b_jonas> i hear there are entire books written as a single sentence, anyway. => yeah. some of them seem like they're just multiple sentences search-replaced to change sentence ending to semicolons.
2019-10-05 16:17:45 <b_jonas> sometimes what I write on irc looks like that too. I should work on writing shorter sentences.

2019-10-05 18:33:17 <shachaf> What is a tutorial?
2019-10-05 18:33:39 <kspalaiologos> something that will help me understanding the concept
2019-10-05 18:33:56 <kspalaiologos> I've been looking for assemblers too, but it seems like I'm out of luck
2019-10-05 18:36:49 <b_jonas> `? tutorial
2019-10-05 18:36:50 <HackEso> tutorial? ¬Ø\(¬∞‚Äã_o)/¬Ø
2019-10-05 18:37:00 <b_jonas> a tutorial is a writeup about burritos I think
2019-10-05 18:37:03 <shachaf> My tutorial is as follows: 1. Learn regular lambda calculus. 2. Learn binary lambda calculus.
2019-10-05 18:37:17 <b_jonas> kspalaiologos: I recommend David Madore's old unlambda writeup
2019-10-05 18:37:35 <b_jonas> www.madore.org/~david/programs/unlambda/
2019-10-05 18:37:38 <b_jonas> um
2019-10-05 18:37:43 <b_jonas> http://www.madore.org/~david/programs/unlambda/
2019-10-05 18:37:47 <b_jonas> stupid browser
2019-10-05 18:37:50 <imode> what's the esolang that has the simplest possible implementation (not necessarily language).
2019-10-05 18:37:59 <kspalaiologos> bytebytejump
2019-10-05 18:38:05 <imode> I recall one being 6 instructions worth of- yeah something like that.
2019-10-05 18:38:32 <b_jonas> imode: that's not a well-defined question, but Three-Star Programmer and Waterfall Model are candidates
2019-10-05 18:38:58 <kspalaiologos> https://github.com/kspalaiologos/MerseneTuringCompletness/blob/master/SeedProof.tex#L581
2019-10-05 18:39:03 <kspalaiologos> feel free to take the C code if you need it
2019-10-05 18:39:28 <b_jonas> also probably bytepusher, but I hate it
2019-10-05 18:39:45 <b_jonas> it's one of my enemy esolangs, like brainfuck
2019-10-05 18:40:07 <b_jonas> "<oerjan> . o O ( some day i will be the last cis male in this channel. )" => after you get rid of me, obviously
2019-10-05 18:40:41 <b_jonas> pikhq: wait, so what gender are you now?
2019-10-05 18:40:55 * pikhq is a girl ^_^
2019-10-05 18:41:22 <imode> kspalaiologos: I don't know what this is.
2019-10-05 18:41:27 <b_jonas> I don't think we'll run out of cis males, because we get replaced by more young cis males that grow up
2019-10-05 18:41:40 <kspalaiologos> imode, it's BBJ interpreter in C
2019-10-05 18:41:44 <kspalaiologos> in this particular line selected
2019-10-05 18:41:52 <imode> ah.
2019-10-05 18:41:55 <b_jonas> I'm more afraid of the scenario when trans people become the majority so the standards flip upside down, and we'll be the weird ones
2019-10-05 18:41:56 <kspalaiologos> the rest of the document won't probably help you much xd
2019-10-05 18:42:02 <b_jonas> but I think even that would be a win for us
2019-10-05 18:43:40 <imode> _what_.
2019-10-05 18:43:53 <imode> bytepusher is a game console using bytebytejump?
2019-10-05 18:43:56 <imode> jesus.
2019-10-05 18:44:01 <imode> that's awesome!
2019-10-05 18:44:22 <kspalaiologos> the more concerning fact is
2019-10-05 18:44:26 <kspalaiologos> they made an assembler for that
2019-10-05 18:44:29 <imode> . o O ( how fast does it run... )
2019-10-05 18:44:35 <kspalaiologos> and binary lambda calculus is still something I'm too stupid for
2019-10-05 18:44:56 <b_jonas> kspalaiologos: why is that concerning? I made an assembler for an OISC too, to be able to use symbolic names that work even if I insert or delete words
2019-10-05 18:45:03 <pikhq> b_jonas: I think, realistically, that is very far off
2019-10-05 18:45:08 <b_jonas> I even added local labels
2019-10-05 18:45:23 <kspalaiologos> b_jonas, well, bytebytejump is a hard thing to get right
2019-10-05 18:45:27 <pikhq> We're only like 0.6% of the overall population
2019-10-05 18:45:29 <kspalaiologos> because of the lookup tables
2019-10-05 18:45:45 <imode> is BBJ turing complete due to lookup tables?
2019-10-05 18:45:53 <kspalaiologos> well, yes
2019-10-05 18:45:58 <kspalaiologos> you can add only using lookup tables
2019-10-05 18:46:00 <kspalaiologos> or subtract
2019-10-05 18:46:08 <imode> wait, BBJ can't be TC..
2019-10-05 18:46:10 <b_jonas> pikhq: who are "we"? trans people, or trans females? and do you count infants into the population?
2019-10-05 18:46:14 <pikhq> Trans people
2019-10-05 18:46:15 <kspalaiologos> so you can make a subleq to bytebytejump compiler
2019-10-05 18:46:28 <kspalaiologos> I'm actually
2019-10-05 18:46:31 <kspalaiologos> really interested in doing that
2019-10-05 18:47:04 <kspalaiologos> oh
2019-10-05 18:47:08 <kspalaiologos> and the nyan cat for bytepusher
2019-10-05 18:47:11 <imode> wtf is the "structured" equivalent of BBJ.
2019-10-05 18:47:13 <kspalaiologos> is 190 kilobytes big
2019-10-05 18:47:37 <imode> that I'm not surprised at, you need so many lookup tables.
2019-10-05 18:47:38 <kspalaiologos> imode, you're left on your own on this one
2019-10-05 18:47:40 <kspalaiologos> good luck
2019-10-05 18:48:02 <b_jonas> pikhq: is there a census on this? I'd like to know the ratio of trans males vs trans females, because it seems like I hear more of trans females somehow, which is weird
2019-10-05 18:48:26 <imode> you can't really have a "structured" equivalent of BBJ, because there's.. no conditional machinery.
2019-10-05 18:49:07 <pikhq> There's relatively few stats on it. I would suspect it's 50/50, and you're biased by the spaces you occupy, _buuut_ there's very limited actual studies.
2019-10-05 18:49:28 <b_jonas> pikhq: yes, I'm quite likely biased, which is why I'd like to know
2019-10-05 18:50:16 <pikhq> https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/How-Many-Adults-Identify-as-Transgender-in-the-United-States.pdf is one of the better demographic studies we've got
2019-10-05 18:50:37 <kspalaiologos> I've experienced that there are more mtf than ftm honestly
2019-10-05 18:51:23 <kspalaiologos> I don't know, although I suppose the reason.
2019-10-05 18:52:48 <b_jonas> pikhq: that gives a split by age, which is useful, but not a split by genders
2019-10-05 18:52:53 <pikhq> You're in tech. We're overrepresented because cis men are overrepresented.
2019-10-05 18:52:56 <pikhq> b_jonas: Yeah
2019-10-05 18:54:51 <zzo38> I don't really know or care too much how many trans people it is, I think if that is what they want to do, OK; but, I think that it can confuse the language in some cases, and I also think that this "gender identity" shouldn't be needed. One suggestion I have seen is for "man" and "woman" to be social but for "male" and "female" to be biological; that helps a bit, I suppose.
2019-10-05 18:55:17 <imode> y'know, I like that distinction.
2019-10-05 18:55:25 <b_jonas> obviously I only know when people tell that they are trans, so for most trans people I probably don't know that they are trans because I don't care
2019-10-05 18:56:05 <b_jonas> so the more trans female is just among people who write on the internet that they are trans female and I read it
2019-10-05 18:56:25 <pikhq> zzo38: I think that's oversimplifying things intensely, and betrays an unfamiliarity with how this shit works
2019-10-05 18:56:56 <pikhq> b_jonas: It appears the institute that did that study is now trying to do a better demographic survey now.
2019-10-05 18:57:08 <pikhq> According to them, it will be the _first_ such demographic survey ever done.
2019-10-05 18:57:14 <zzo38> pikhq: Yes, it is simplifying it. You can have sex change too, so you can be a kind of hybrid, too. (You can also be born as a hybrid of male and female; it does happen.)
2019-10-05 18:57:16 <b_jonas> that seems quite likely
2019-10-05 18:58:08 <pikhq> zzo38: Additionally, much of what we think of "biological sex" is, uh, purely hormonal.
2019-10-05 18:58:26 <imode> you cannot take enough hormones to turn your penis into a vagina.
2019-10-05 18:58:31 <imode> and vice versa.
2019-10-05 18:58:35 <imode> so no, it really isn't.
2019-10-05 18:58:39 <imode> it's genetic.
2019-10-05 18:58:55 <pikhq> imode: Developmentally speaking, your penis was once a vagina, and then testosterone happened.
2019-10-05 18:58:59 <zzo38> But, I think that even if a person is a "man" and not a "woman", if they are biologically female (or had the functions of such) at the time their child was born, then they are that child's mother. And if (hypothetically) someone can manage to change their biological sex enough from female to male later and have another child as the male function, then they can be one person's mother and another person's father.
2019-10-05 18:59:20 <imode> pikhq: I'm pretty sure I'm a male because of my chromosomes.
2019-10-05 18:59:23 <pikhq> zzo38: The mere act of "defining biologically female" is itself _much_ more difficult than you think.
2019-10-05 18:59:38 <pikhq> imode: Orly? Have you actually had a karyotype done?
2019-10-05 18:59:52 <imode> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome basic biology.
2019-10-05 19:00:21 <imode> if you wanna argue gender identity, whatever. but biology is biology.
2019-10-05 19:00:35 <pikhq> imode: Bio 102: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testis-determining_factor
2019-10-05 19:00:52 <zzo38> pikhq: Yes, I know it is more complicated (I don't know all of the details, but I know it is more complicated than the simplified version I mentioned)
2019-10-05 19:01:11 <pikhq> imode: TLDR: shut up, you don't know what you're talking about, you're just being an ass.
2019-10-05 19:01:13 <imode> congratulations, that doesn't change your genetic makeup.
2019-10-05 19:01:29 <imode> TL;DR stop discussing this in this channel.
2019-10-05 19:01:34 <pikhq> imode: Unless you have actually had a genetic test, you don't even know what your genetic makeup is.
2019-10-05 19:01:46 <pikhq> imode: Oh fuck off.
2019-10-05 19:01:50 <imode> you first.
2019-10-05 19:02:32 <pikhq> You're the one who's being offensive and self-righteous. That you are upsetting me intentionally in this way is _your_ fault.
2019-10-05 19:02:43 <imode> have fun on ignore.
2019-10-05 19:03:02 <pikhq> ops: Do we have a policy on offensive BS?

2019-10-05 19:03:49 <j4cbo> ‚Äúbut chromosomes‚Äù is a pretty low quality argument tbh
2019-10-05 19:03:56 <pikhq> ^
2019-10-05 19:04:08 <zzo38> Maybe much of it is purely hormonal, but there is also genetics, and perhaps other stuff, so, it is complicated. I don't know how it works though; I am not a biologist. But, I think that chromosomes are probably a part of it.
2019-10-05 19:04:08 <b_jonas> sorry, I didn't wnat to start that
2019-10-05 19:04:44 <pikhq> zzo38: They are -- ish. There's a gene that is commonly on the Y chromosome that triggers the production of certain hormones that triggers a large pile of other phenotypical changes.
2019-10-05 19:04:51 <zzo38> (And, a X chromosome, is, normally, something that both male and female will have.)
2019-10-05 19:04:54 <pikhq> It's actually _stunningly_ complicated.
2019-10-05 19:05:09 <pikhq> And there's plenty of ways for it to go screwy.
2019-10-05 19:05:11 <zzo38> OK, I believe you.
2019-10-05 19:05:26 <zzo38> (even if I do not understand it completely)
2019-10-05 19:05:37 <pikhq> For instance, the gene is only _usually_ on the Y chromosome. It moves over to the X sometimes. There's literally XX cis men walking around.
2019-10-05 19:06:54 <zzo38> Yes, OK. I didn't know that, but, OK.
2019-10-05 19:06:57 <j4cbo> biological sex is complicated but at least it is amenable to scientific inquiry
2019-10-05 19:07:18 <pikhq> j4cbo: Gender identity is too -- people are real, even if they're fuzzy and harder to measure. :)
2019-10-05 19:07:27 <imode> the concentration of mentally ill people on IRC never ceases to amaze me.
2019-10-05 19:07:37 <pikhq> ops: ^
2019-10-05 19:08:13 <j4cbo> pikhq: identity sure, but societal expectations and roles are impossibly complicated
2019-10-05 19:08:28 <zzo38> (It seems to me that such thing as "XX cis men" might be a kind of hybrid, since "XX" is supposed to designate female, but in this case they are otherwise male; but, I don't really know what the proper definitions are, so I may be wrong.)
2019-10-05 19:08:43 <pikhq> So's physics. I hear physics is a well-established field.
2019-10-05 19:09:02 <pikhq> zzo38: The sex-determining region Y is more-or-less the only functional content of the Y chromosome.
2019-10-05 19:09:18 <j4cbo> physics is measurable in ways that culture is not
2019-10-05 19:09:38 <pikhq> Which is why sociology is hard.
2019-10-05 19:09:44 <zzo38> OK
2019-10-05 19:10:12 <pikhq> But it's real, so you can _do_ science on it. Just... hopelessly difficult, so expect to spend all your time on establishing basic results.

2019-10-05 19:12:03 * pikhq is beginning to see why some other former regulars abandoned this channel
2019-10-05 19:14:36 <j4cbo> Freenode‚Äôs ‚Äúops should not wear hats‚Äù thing is unhelpful imo
2019-10-05 19:14:55 <imode> define wear hats.
2019-10-05 19:15:24 <pikhq> j4cbo: Yeah, it makes it difficult to decide who to escalate a conflict over what is appropriate discussion in a channel to.
2019-10-05 19:16:12 <imode> if you mean take particular sides in a discussion, no, they really shouldn't. discussions and disagreements happen all the time.
2019-10-05 19:16:20 <j4cbo> imode: ‚Äúops should not have +o except when actively using it‚Äù
2019-10-05 19:16:34 <imode> ah, that. eh.
2019-10-05 19:16:39 <pikhq> Is imode an op? Please say no
2019-10-05 19:16:44 <j4cbo> which leads to a... unmoderated atmosphere
2019-10-05 19:16:50 <j4cbo> I don‚Äôt think so?
2019-10-05 19:16:54 <pikhq> Ah, good
2019-10-05 19:17:20 <imode> I don't feel strongly one way or the other. I guess it's more relaxed in some places but I've never had a problem knowing who the ops are.
2019-10-05 19:17:22 <pikhq> "An op's conduct is incompatible with what I think is appropriate for this channel" is not a pleasant discussion to have.
2019-10-05 19:17:33 <b_jonas> j4cbo: our channel operators are fizzie, oerjan and ais523. same as the wiki moderators. you can tell that from NICKSERV ACCESS #esoteric LIST. the hats don't matter.
2019-10-05 19:17:50 <imode> welcome to #esoteric, where the languages are weird and the hats don't matter.
2019-10-05 19:18:24 <b_jonas> but I think this is the sort of discussion that you can just walk away from, it doesn't need ops
2019-10-05 19:19:26 <pikhq> b_jonas: I am inclined to disagree. It's pretty... Incompatible with me being welcome here at all.
2019-10-05 19:19:30 <imode> is pikhq trying to get me banned or something for disagreeing with them. if so, that's amazing.

2019-10-05 19:20:09 <zzo38> I think that you can temporarily ignore the IRC if you do not like it and later you can discuss something else on this IRC. Since, we discuss other stuff on this IRC, too.
2019-10-05 19:20:09 <b_jonas> pikhq: I mean, it's a discussion that will die down in a few hours if you ignore it, and it isn't interwoven with some other important discussion that you can't miss at the same time
2019-10-05 19:20:14 <j4cbo> imode: i think your comments have gone substantially beyond ‚Äúdisagreeing‚Äù
2019-10-05 19:20:22 <imode> j4cbo: such as.
2019-10-05 19:20:38 <j4cbo> the ‚Äúmentally ill‚Äù remarks
2019-10-05 19:20:42 <pikhq> ^
2019-10-05 19:20:43 <imode> not related to this channel.
2019-10-05 19:20:51 <j4cbo> bullshit
2019-10-05 19:20:57 <zzo38> Even if you do want to ignore some discussion when reading the logs, if they are a discussion by different people, you could use grep, perhaps
2019-10-05 19:20:59 <imode> not even related to this server.
2019-10-05 19:21:12 <pikhq> b_jonas: Yeah, calling me "mentally ill" is straight-up insulting me for who I am.
2019-10-05 19:21:24 <j4cbo> imode: it did not read that way
2019-10-05 19:21:30 <imode> sorry you parsed it that way.
2019-10-05 19:21:44 <imode> should have probably qualified. the discussion ended for me on "have fun on ignore."
2019-10-05 19:21:59 <b_jonas> pikhq: yes, I do realize. so ignore the whole discussion. unlike on a high-traffic channel where you have to separate threads, you can easily skip over them.
2019-10-05 19:22:23 <pikhq> b_jonas: This is about as inappropriate as calling someone a "f****t"
2019-10-05 19:22:30 <imode> maybe everybody needs to just step away from their computers and take a walk.

2019-10-05 19:22:48 <j4cbo> ‚Äústop discussing this in this channel‚Äù is also not your call to make
2019-10-05 19:23:06 <imode> that I'll accept. was an opinion and shouldn't have come across as an order.
2019-10-05 19:23:15 <j4cbo> imode: so maybe the only one who needs to step away is... you?
2019-10-05 19:23:24 <imode> pretty comfortable where I am, actually.
2019-10-05 19:23:27 <pikhq> Maybe I should join every other trans person who's ever been in this channel and leave. (there have been several)
2019-10-05 19:23:47 <b_jonas> no, all of you should step away. I wasn't specific about who.
2019-10-05 19:24:43 <j4cbo> anyway I‚Äôm out for now
2019-10-05 19:24:51 <b_jonas> and return a few hours later, but after a random amount of time so you don't return all at the same time (which is a proven working strategy on all our ethernet and wifi networks), by which time we'll forget about this
2019-10-05 19:25:00 <b_jonas> but I'm sorry again for starting this
2019-10-05 19:25:09 <imode> not your fault.

2019-10-05 19:45:05 <b_jonas> `? ronald reagan
2019-10-05 19:45:06 <HackEso> Ronald Reagan was an actor so great that he managed to convince the US that he was the President. Then he created the Star Wars project to destroy the Soviet Union.
2019-10-05 19:45:08 <b_jonas> `? star wars
2019-10-05 19:45:09 <HackEso> Star Wars was a missile defence system invented by Ronald Reagan. With it, he managed to destroy the Soviet Union, then rode into the sunset.
2019-10-05 19:45:10 <b_jonas> `? soviet union
2019-10-05 19:45:11 <HackEso> In ancient history, the Soviet Union used to be the THEM. They believed in absurd principles like "Better Red than Dead". Then Ronald Reagan invented Star Wars to destroy it, after which there seemed to be no the THEM for a while.
2019-10-05 19:45:20 <b_jonas> `? daystar
2019-10-05 19:45:21 <HackEso> The Daystar is an unscientific myth of a bright orb glowing in the sky outside only at the times you're in your office.
2019-10-05 19:45:22 <b_jonas> `? nightstar
2019-10-05 19:45:23 <HackEso> The Nightstars are an unscientific myth of a sky covered in faint flickering lights. Only hermits and superstitious farmers believe this.

2019-10-05 19:45:43 <HackEso> A BOFH is a bastard operator from hell. An example is the == operator in PHP.
