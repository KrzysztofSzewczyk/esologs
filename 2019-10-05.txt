2019-10-05 00:00:37 <imode> my question is, without this mechanism (which has implications regarding the uniqueness of the generated binding), is it still turing complete?
2019-10-05 00:02:45 <imode> I don't see how it could be. if I treat the tuple store as a set rather than a bag, there's no way to generate unique tuples without explicitly listing them all.
2019-10-05 00:03:30 <imode> if I treat it as a bag, then I could probably construct some sort of counter.
2019-10-05 00:17:38 <zzo38> I wrote this list of ideas for the game; to see if they like or dislike them or can make variants of it to make a more surprise to me. https://arin.ga/JfMezt What is your opinion of this, please? Do you have any further ideas please?

2019-10-05 00:55:25 <Lykaina> i can't make any sense of the irc program i wrote 10+ years ago
2019-10-05 00:55:28 <Lykaina> it's 8 bash shell scripts, uses 100% cpu...
2019-10-05 00:55:31 <Lykaina> all i know
2019-10-05 00:56:50 <zzo38> You should write it to not use 100% CPU.
2019-10-05 00:57:08 <Lykaina> it wasn't intentional
2019-10-05 00:58:08 <zzo38> O, OK
2019-10-05 00:59:32 <zzo38> I use IRC program I wrote by myself. If I were writing it today though I probably would do some things differently, such as not using PHP (I didn't have anything better at that time).
2019-10-05 01:00:42 <Lykaina> no idea how beetle (it's name) works.
2019-10-05 01:04:09 <zzo38> Other than using 100% CPU, is it any good?
2019-10-05 01:04:30 <Lykaina> i remember that it is, in a sense, multiple programs working as one.
2019-10-05 01:04:31 <fizzie> I had an IRC thing (though I think it might've been an ircII script) that used 100% of CPU too, except it was on my ISP's shared shell server and got me shouted at.
2019-10-05 01:04:45 <pikhq> *wince*
2019-10-05 01:05:14 <fizzie> It wasn't a particularly large ISP.
2019-10-05 01:05:26 <fizzie> They got acquired at least three levels deep, eventually.

2019-10-05 01:33:45 <shachaf> If you want to define busy-beaver-style numbers in a way people will easily agree on, what computation system should you use?
2019-10-05 01:34:25 <shachaf> The classic one with Turing machines has questions like whether the tape is double-sided, whether blank is a separate symbol, whether you count number of steps or output size, etc.
2019-10-05 01:34:53 <shachaf> What's a sequence that grows as quickly as BB but can be defined unambiguously in one sentence?
2019-10-05 01:35:19 <shachaf> I was thinking maybe somthing about the solution to a Diophantine equation of some size, but then defining the size of an equation is slightly awkward.
2019-10-05 01:35:33 <pikhq> Hmm, tricky. I think the most important property for such a computation system (beyond being TC, of course) is being simple to state unambiguously.
2019-10-05 01:45:22 <kmc> can you define something analogous to busy beaver machines with lambda calculus or combinators?
2019-10-05 01:46:01 <shachaf> Sure.
2019-10-05 01:46:12 <shachaf> You can count the number of reductions or something.
2019-10-05 01:46:14 <kmc> yep
2019-10-05 01:46:29 <shachaf> Or just produce a large number.
2019-10-05 01:46:42 <pikhq> Yeah, I guess a SKI combinator busy beaver makes sense
2019-10-05 01:46:43 <kmc> B(n) = the maximum number of reduction steps to normal form for a combinator string of size n

2019-10-05 01:47:12 <oerjan> even those cases still require you to define the syntax to measure size.
2019-10-05 01:47:43 <kmc> true
2019-10-05 01:47:55 <kmc> but it's just a tree where leaves are labeled S or K, right?
2019-10-05 01:48:06 <kmc> a binary tree
2019-10-05 01:50:52 <oerjan> still more one way to count that :P
2019-10-05 01:50:57 <oerjan> *+than
2019-10-05 01:51:10 <kmc> sure
2019-10-05 01:51:15 <kmc> but it should fit in one sentence
2019-10-05 01:51:21 <kmc> which was the original goal
2019-10-05 01:51:33 <kmc> if you have to define S and K then it'd be a bit of a run-on sentence but whatever
