2019-10-05 00:00:37 <imode> my question is, without this mechanism (which has implications regarding the uniqueness of the generated binding), is it still turing complete?
2019-10-05 00:02:45 <imode> I don't see how it could be. if I treat the tuple store as a set rather than a bag, there's no way to generate unique tuples without explicitly listing them all.
2019-10-05 00:03:30 <imode> if I treat it as a bag, then I could probably construct some sort of counter.
2019-10-05 00:17:38 <zzo38> I wrote this list of ideas for the game; to see if they like or dislike them or can make variants of it to make a more surprise to me. https://arin.ga/JfMezt What is your opinion of this, please? Do you have any further ideas please?

2019-10-05 00:55:25 <Lykaina> i can't make any sense of the irc program i wrote 10+ years ago
2019-10-05 00:55:28 <Lykaina> it's 8 bash shell scripts, uses 100% cpu...
2019-10-05 00:55:31 <Lykaina> all i know
2019-10-05 00:56:50 <zzo38> You should write it to not use 100% CPU.
2019-10-05 00:57:08 <Lykaina> it wasn't intentional
2019-10-05 00:58:08 <zzo38> O, OK
2019-10-05 00:59:32 <zzo38> I use IRC program I wrote by myself. If I were writing it today though I probably would do some things differently, such as not using PHP (I didn't have anything better at that time).
2019-10-05 01:00:42 <Lykaina> no idea how beetle (it's name) works.
2019-10-05 01:04:09 <zzo38> Other than using 100% CPU, is it any good?
2019-10-05 01:04:30 <Lykaina> i remember that it is, in a sense, multiple programs working as one.
2019-10-05 01:04:31 <fizzie> I had an IRC thing (though I think it might've been an ircII script) that used 100% of CPU too, except it was on my ISP's shared shell server and got me shouted at.
2019-10-05 01:04:45 <pikhq> *wince*
2019-10-05 01:05:14 <fizzie> It wasn't a particularly large ISP.
2019-10-05 01:05:26 <fizzie> They got acquired at least three levels deep, eventually.

2019-10-05 01:33:45 <shachaf> If you want to define busy-beaver-style numbers in a way people will easily agree on, what computation system should you use?
2019-10-05 01:34:25 <shachaf> The classic one with Turing machines has questions like whether the tape is double-sided, whether blank is a separate symbol, whether you count number of steps or output size, etc.
2019-10-05 01:34:53 <shachaf> What's a sequence that grows as quickly as BB but can be defined unambiguously in one sentence?
2019-10-05 01:35:19 <shachaf> I was thinking maybe somthing about the solution to a Diophantine equation of some size, but then defining the size of an equation is slightly awkward.
2019-10-05 01:35:33 <pikhq> Hmm, tricky. I think the most important property for such a computation system (beyond being TC, of course) is being simple to state unambiguously.
2019-10-05 01:45:22 <kmc> can you define something analogous to busy beaver machines with lambda calculus or combinators?
2019-10-05 01:46:01 <shachaf> Sure.
2019-10-05 01:46:12 <shachaf> You can count the number of reductions or something.
2019-10-05 01:46:14 <kmc> yep
2019-10-05 01:46:29 <shachaf> Or just produce a large number.
2019-10-05 01:46:42 <pikhq> Yeah, I guess a SKI combinator busy beaver makes sense
2019-10-05 01:46:43 <kmc> B(n) = the maximum number of reduction steps to normal form for a combinator string of size n

2019-10-05 01:47:12 <oerjan> even those cases still require you to define the syntax to measure size.
2019-10-05 01:47:43 <kmc> true
2019-10-05 01:47:55 <kmc> but it's just a tree where leaves are labeled S or K, right?
2019-10-05 01:48:06 <kmc> a binary tree
2019-10-05 01:50:52 <oerjan> still more one way to count that :P
2019-10-05 01:50:57 <oerjan> *+than
2019-10-05 01:51:10 <kmc> sure
2019-10-05 01:51:15 <kmc> but it should fit in one sentence
2019-10-05 01:51:21 <kmc> which was the original goal
2019-10-05 01:51:33 <kmc> if you have to define S and K then it'd be a bit of a run-on sentence but whatever

2019-10-05 04:36:52 <Hooloovo0> I've done a bit of meditation
2019-10-05 04:38:23 <Hooloovo0> basically all I've done is go into a hypnagogic state while my brain is still awake, basically lay completely still for a long time
2019-10-05 04:39:51 <Hooloovo0> eventually you should feel an, uh, weight, or numbness, leading down your extremities
2019-10-05 04:42:33 <Hooloovo0> it's weird not having any (changing) sensory input at all...
2019-10-05 04:55:42 <zzo38> How to control the set of characters that pushing control and a arrow key skips to in the location bar in Firefox? I want it to skip to only / & = # ?
2019-10-05 05:00:00 <kmc> Hooloovo0: cool
2019-10-05 05:00:08 <kmc> I'm going to try a sensory deprivation float tank probably next week
2019-10-05 05:00:17 <kmc> and see what that's like
2019-10-05 05:00:47 <Hooloovo0> fun, let me know how that goes
2019-10-05 05:00:59 <kmc> sure thing
2019-10-05 05:02:50 <Hooloovo0> I feel like a sensory deprivation tank would produce the same effects as I get, but I'm not sure if there's anything else I'm not (sensing/feeling/experiencing)

2019-10-05 05:21:23 <kmc> mhm
2019-10-05 05:21:28 <kmc> well, it'll be different for everyone anyway
2019-10-05 05:21:33 <kmc> but I'm glad to share my experiences
2019-10-05 05:21:52 <kmc> I have a longstanding interest in altered mental states.
2019-10-05 05:22:20 <kmc> one semester in college I had 2 roommates so I built the space under my desk into a sensory isolation sleeping pod
2019-10-05 05:22:23 <kmc> it was great
2019-10-05 05:22:38 <kmc> I had a thick piece of wood and blackout curtains that I could slide against the open side
2019-10-05 05:22:55 <kmc> I slept in there, would also watch tv on my laptop, or listen to music in the dark
2019-10-05 05:23:19 <kmc> and i'm also into psychedelic drugs but you know that.
2019-10-05 05:23:31 <kmc> zzo38: have you ever taken psychedelic drugs?
2019-10-05 05:24:02 <kmc> I have tried to meditate a bit, but never made a habit of it; I am much better at forming habits now than I was the last time I tried, so maybe it will stick this time
2019-10-05 05:24:12 <kmc> my therapist recommend going to some events at the SF Zen Center
2019-10-05 05:24:34 <kmc> hynagogic states are interesting
2019-10-05 05:24:42 <kmc> hypnagogic*
2019-10-05 05:24:53 <kmc> as are dreams
2019-10-05 05:25:02 <kmc> I have used galantamine a couple of times to enhance dreaming
2019-10-05 05:25:56 <Hooloovo0> I have never had a real habit of meditating
2019-10-05 05:26:31 <Hooloovo0> it's always been somethting I do once every 2 days - 2 months ish
2019-10-05 05:27:04 <kmc> mm
2019-10-05 05:27:16 <Hooloovo0> I did take a class on buddhism which I thought was really great
2019-10-05 05:27:21 <kmc> cool
2019-10-05 05:29:32 <Hooloovo0> the professor is a monk - he teaches at a monestary/university and I don't know what else to say
2019-10-05 05:30:09 <kmc> cool
2019-10-05 05:30:58 <kmc> another thing i do that is maybe a bit like meditation (or maybe even the opposite) is to listen to music intently in a way that crowds out 'verbal' thoughts
2019-10-05 05:31:03 <kmc> it feels good
2019-10-05 05:32:20 <kmc> at some point in my late teens I gained the ability to follow multiple voices in music in a deeper way than I could before -- in a way that actually feels like multithreaded attention
2019-10-05 05:32:56 <kmc> this happened shortly after I first smoked pot, i don't know if that's related but plausibly
2019-10-05 05:33:04 <Hooloovo0> I feel like "not thinking verbal thoughts" is a distinct state of consciousness different from a lot of others
2019-10-05 05:34:39 <kmc> yeah
2019-10-05 05:34:47 <kmc> and the goal of many forms of meditation is to reach this state?
2019-10-05 05:35:04 <Hooloovo0> it's what you get from listening while high af, and (chanting/dancing/etc) while arguably sober
2019-10-05 05:35:12 <Hooloovo0> yeah
2019-10-05 05:37:24 <kmc> i think drugs usually *don't* help me get there
2019-10-05 05:37:39 <kmc> because i am very analytical and keep trying to describe the drug experience in words (in my own head or to others)
2019-10-05 05:38:31 <kmc> and even if that's not where my attention focuses, i get really analytical on psychedelics
2019-10-05 05:38:35 <kmc> cannabis might be better for it
2019-10-05 05:38:50 <kmc> but yeah I think listening to music intently (whether sober or not) is the best way I know to do it
2019-10-05 05:39:00 <Hooloovo0> that makes sense... when I take drugs, I always think about how it's different from base reality
2019-10-05 05:39:41 <Hooloovo0> I have not tried psychadelics, just weed, so there's that
2019-10-05 05:39:54 <Hooloovo0> well, weed/booze
2019-10-05 05:40:07 <kmc> from this discussion I get the feeling that you would find psychedelics interesting :)
2019-10-05 05:40:36 <Hooloovo0> yes, I think so
2019-10-05 05:40:51 <Hooloovo0> I mean I'm sure theyd be interesting
2019-10-05 05:41:26 <Hooloovo0> I'm not actually sure why I have qualms about taking them
2019-10-05 05:41:41 <Hooloovo0> never had an easy chance to
2019-10-05 05:42:03 <kmc> yeah
2019-10-05 05:43:01 <kmc> good to wait and do it right
2019-10-05 05:43:12 <kmc> because the experience is determined mostly by set&setting and not by the drug itself
2019-10-05 05:43:26 <kmc> stanislav grof called LSD a "nonspecific amplifier of mental processes" or something like that, and I think he's right
2019-10-05 05:43:44 <kmc> I think of it as turning up the gain on all sorts of pattern matching systems
2019-10-05 05:44:25 <kmc> so you start to see things that aren't there, but also things that are real and had eluded you previously
2019-10-05 05:44:33 <kmc> not just in the literal sense of 'see' but also with respect to emotions and cognition
2019-10-05 05:44:42 <kmc> but, it's hard to put it into words of course.
2019-10-05 05:46:57 <Hooloovo0> yeah, see/experience/feel are different
2019-10-05 05:47:20 <kmc> then on the more intense experiences the subject/object boundary itself becomes permeable, or dissolves entirely
2019-10-05 05:47:58 <Hooloovo0> I'm not entirely sure I understand that sentence
2019-10-05 05:48:14 <kmc> which is impossible to describe. anything you say about it is a contradiction because our way of talking is essentially predicated on that distinction
2019-10-05 05:48:27 <kmc> a statement like "I experienced ego death" is obviously contradictory
2019-10-05 05:48:32 <kmc> and yet
2019-10-05 05:48:52 <kmc> ego death is... a thing that happens

2019-10-05 05:48:57 <kmc> it doesn't happen *to* anyone
2019-10-05 05:49:33 <kmc> I was essentially a panpsychist before I started taking psychedelics but it's one thing to believe something and another to experience it, you know?
2019-10-05 05:49:45 <kmc> that there is only one thing, which is you and me and the universe and God and doesn't even need a name
2019-10-05 05:49:57 <kmc> and all the boundaries are heuristics we impose on the world
2019-10-05 05:50:19 <shachaf> When I was a v. small human I remember just naturally thinking that everyone was the same person.
2019-10-05 05:50:31 <shachaf> And being surprised at the realization that maybe that's not true.
2019-10-05 05:50:38 <shachaf> Of course it could be a fake memory like most of my earliest memories.
2019-10-05 05:50:41 <kmc> did you include yourself in that?
2019-10-05 05:50:49 <kmc> how do you know your early memories are fake?
2019-10-05 05:50:51 <shachaf> Yes.
2019-10-05 05:51:14 <Hooloovo0> ++
2019-10-05 05:51:27 <kmc> I don't have a lot of childhood memories. I'm told this is a thing that happens with dissociation
2019-10-05 05:51:30 <kmc> but maybe I have enough
2019-10-05 05:51:33 <shachaf> Some of them I can tell because they match stories that I've been told, but then when I ask about further details it turns out they're wrong (e.g. not in the place I thought).
2019-10-05 05:51:44 <kmc> mm
2019-10-05 05:52:16 <Hooloovo0> I'm not sure what you mean by the me/universe/god statement
2019-10-05 05:52:26 <shachaf> Others I think are fake due to other heuristics but I don't remember the details now.
2019-10-05 05:52:28 <kmc> Hooloovo0: I'm only going to make a fool of myself if I try
2019-10-05 05:52:31 <kmc> that's how these things go
2019-10-05 05:52:52 <kmc> lexande frequently submits corrections to my autobiography
2019-10-05 05:52:54 <Hooloovo0> I know
2019-10-05 05:53:01 <kmc> I think his memory is better than mine overall
2019-10-05 05:55:44 <Hooloovo0> before searching for it again I felt like https://principiadiscordia.com/book/57.php
2019-10-05 05:55:47 <Hooloovo0> might be relevant
2019-10-05 05:55:52 <zzo38> When any player casts a spell, that player may choose a number which is a multiple of the converted mana cost of that spell, is less than or equal to forty, and has not yet been chosen for ~. If they do not, they lose five life.
2019-10-05 05:56:00 <Hooloovo0> re-searching?
2019-10-05 05:57:18 <kmc> Hooloovo0: that is a nice page
2019-10-05 05:57:28 <kmc> I was pretty into discordianism as a teenager
2019-10-05 05:57:34 <kmc> I should probably go back and read the texts again
2019-10-05 05:57:36 <zzo38> Hooloovo0: I read that before, and, I think it is good.
2019-10-05 05:57:49 * Hooloovo0 reads logs: I know was re: (I'll make a fool of myself if I try)
2019-10-05 05:58:01 <kmc> "Pick a grid, and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears disordered. Pick another grid, and the same chaos will appear differently ordered and disordered."
2019-10-05 05:58:07 <kmc> this can be made mathematically precise in quantum mechanics
2019-10-05 05:58:31 <Hooloovo0> that's one of the reasons I like it
2019-10-05 05:58:34 <kmc> you have different basis sets for a hilbert space
2019-10-05 05:58:48 <zzo38> kmc: Yes, I suppose so. I have not considered that, but, yes, that makes sense.
2019-10-05 05:58:49 <kmc> a state that looks entangled in one basis is separated in another
2019-10-05 05:58:58 <kmc> and everything you do in the system is basically a change of basis?
2019-10-05 05:59:20 <shachaf> Wait, does entanglement depend on your basis?
2019-10-05 05:59:21 <zzo38> One book about philosophy that I had read some time ago, mentioned, quoting someone else, they expected you can write a serious book about philosophy consisting entirely of jokes. Now I can think that is correct, because that is what Principia Discordia is.
2019-10-05 05:59:22 <kmc> quantum observation is choosing a basis and then projecting the system state onto it
2019-10-05 05:59:25 <kmc> shachaf: maybe not
2019-10-05 05:59:36 <shachaf> I thought that, like being a rank-1 matrix, separability was basis-independent.
2019-10-05 05:59:55 <kmc> zzo38: that seems about right
2019-10-05 06:00:33 <shachaf> whoa, I had a basic question about quantum things that maybe you know the answer to.
2019-10-05 06:00:47 <kmc> you shouldn't expect me to be correct
2019-10-05 06:00:55 <shachaf> I feel like all the quantum things I know, like entanglement, can be local.
2019-10-05 06:00:57 <kmc> especially in my current state
2019-10-05 06:01:03 <shachaf> But I don't know what locality means.
2019-10-05 06:01:08 <shachaf> What do I do?
2019-10-05 06:02:02 <zzo38> I have looked at the mathematics of quantum state vectors, and it does seem like some states might be entangled or unentangled from some point of view. But, it is confusing and apparently even scientists do not understand so well, so I have heard?
2019-10-05 06:02:22 <Hooloovo0> zzo38, no, the PD is completely serious. there's no jokes in it
2019-10-05 06:02:42 <shachaf> zzo38: I think the specific thing about whether a state is separable or not is just regular multilinear algebra that people do understand?
2019-10-05 06:02:43 * Hooloovo0 goes to get a hot dog
2019-10-05 06:03:27 <zzo38> shachaf: Probably you are correct.
2019-10-05 06:04:51 <zzo38> Hooloovo0: Are you sure there is no jokes in it? I thought it is completely serious despite it consists entirely of jokes.
