2020-07-24 00:45:11 <Cale> Enchant creature. When enchanted creature dies, you may play a replacement creature card from your hand as if it had flash. If you do, return all permanents that were attached to enchanted creature from the graveyard to the battlefield under your control attached to the replacement creature.
2020-07-24 00:45:59 <shachaf> That's neat.
2020-07-24 00:47:44 <zzo38> That is good, but maybe make enchant permanent, and then you can play another card that shares a type with it. The other consideration is if you do not control or do not own the enchanted permanent, then?
2020-07-24 00:50:38 <zzo38> I like the idea though.
2020-07-24 00:51:38 <zzo38> Maybe it is supposed to work on opponent's cards and then you control the replacement, though, in which case that is OK.
2020-07-24 00:51:44 <shachaf> i,i enchant spell on the stack
2020-07-24 00:52:29 <zzo38> "on the stack" is redundant (an object is only a "spell" while it is on the stack), although I had that idea too.
2020-07-24 00:53:22 <shachaf> Then you could replace a spell on the stack with another spell -- even a sorcery? -- but it would keep its existing stack position.

2020-07-24 00:53:42 <pikhq> Cale: Oh that is _nice_
2020-07-24 00:53:58 <pikhq> That makes other enchantments better!
2020-07-24 00:54:58 <pikhq> shachaf: enchant spell or ability on the stack >:D
2020-07-24 00:55:15 <shachaf> pikhq: I was considering that a bit but it seemed too far even for me.
2020-07-24 00:56:02 <Cale> Yeah, it's a card that works for and against auras :)
2020-07-24 00:56:29 <zzo38> I had another idea about recovering Auras:  The next time a nontoken Aura dies this turn, you may cast it.
2020-07-24 00:57:44 <shachaf> Cale: Oh, whoa, you could enchant an opponent's creature with this.
2020-07-24 00:57:46 <shachaf> I didn't think of that.
2020-07-24 00:58:23 <pikhq> Oooh
2020-07-24 00:58:25 <pikhq> Sneaky
2020-07-24 00:58:36 <zzo38> Yes, I thought of that too, which is what I was mentioning
2020-07-24 00:58:52 <pikhq> To a lesser extent, that also works against equipment
2020-07-24 00:59:00 <shachaf> Oh, zzo38 said that too, I missed it.
2020-07-24 00:59:03 <pikhq> I mean you can always re-equip, but that can be costly
2020-07-24 00:59:32 <Cale> Also stealing opponents' equipment perhaps
