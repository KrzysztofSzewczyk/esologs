2020-04-27 00:01:09 <Train> zzo38, I got the first part of the minsky engine working
2020-04-27 00:01:21 <Train> now i just need instruction handling
2020-04-27 00:09:19 <zzo38> OK
2020-04-27 00:13:54 <Train> https://esolangs.org/wiki/PATH is very similar to TrainCode
2020-04-27 00:30:57 <pikhq> Malbolge is kinda interesting just by way of picking the least convenient option for each and every design decision that came up.
2020-04-27 00:31:56 <pikhq> It's possible to make something more just straight-up weird I imagine, but I imagine not much less _useable_ without making serious sacrifices in theoretical capabilities.
2020-04-27 00:32:05 <Train> Yeah.

2020-04-27 01:41:36 <zzo38> Yes, I would think so. But you can still write, if you have something to write, I suppose.
2020-04-27 01:42:56 User Name: TrainCode = TrainCode!ca9a8601@202-154-134-1.ubs-dynamic.connections.net.nz
2020-04-27 01:42:56 <TrainCode> And we can see what you have said through the logs.
2020-04-27 01:44:22 <TrainCode> So you can still have a conversation with them.
2020-04-27 01:44:38 <TrainCode> _test_
2020-04-27 01:46:53 <pikhq> lmao
2020-04-27 01:46:59 <pikhq> yeah, i suppose that's true
2020-04-27 01:47:31 * pikhq shall have to act as though people can read her words without being present
2020-04-27 01:48:34 <pikhq> I forgot this channel has people who catch up on goings-on while absent by reading the public logs xd
2020-04-27 01:48:39 <pikhq> It's been a while, admittedly
2020-04-27 01:48:46 <TrainCode> I do what.
2020-04-27 01:48:48 <TrainCode> *that.
2020-04-27 01:48:54 <TrainCode> Is that weird?
2020-04-27 01:52:39 <pikhq> No, it's actually culturally normal _here_. I think this is the only channel I've been in where it's all that common though.
2020-04-27 01:53:01 <TrainCode> hack.chat/?programming has it happen a lot
2020-04-27 01:53:14 * pikhq shrugs
2020-04-27 01:58:19 <fizzie> It's kind of uncommon on Freenode.
2020-04-27 01:58:42 <pikhq> I suppose it's not that surprising given the logs in the topic though
2020-04-27 01:58:52 <pikhq> Which has been a thing for... ages?
2020-04-27 01:59:15 <pikhq> Think that was there even back when I first joined. ... god, like 15 years ago
2020-04-27 02:00:13 <TrainCode> On hackchat, most people have some sort of logger bot.
2020-04-27 02:00:28 <TrainCode> Because the server doesn't store chatlogs.
2020-04-27 02:00:39 <pikhq> I connect via a bouncer these days
2020-04-27 02:01:07 <TrainCode> Paranoid much?

2020-04-27 02:02:29 <pikhq> The bouncer is being used for always-on and having shared client state between multiple systems, not for privacy reasons really
2020-04-27 02:02:53 <TrainCode> Okay.
2020-04-27 02:03:04 <zzo38> Freenode server doesn't store chat logs either I think; there is the bots to store the logs. (It is possible though to make a IRC server that does make public logs of public channels, although most don't.)
2020-04-27 02:03:28 <pikhq> Better not be for privacy, seeing as "pikhq" is what I go by basically everywhere and you can pretty trivially find where in the world I live and where I work from there :)
2020-04-27 02:04:26 <TrainCode> Hey, do you guys wanna talk on a hackchat?
2020-04-27 02:05:23 <fizzie> Ooh, we have indeed had public logs for quite awhile.
2020-04-27 02:05:26 <fizzie> [2003-01-18 02:49:02] < hcf> lament: would you like clog to log #esoteric?
2020-04-27 02:05:26 <fizzie> [2003-01-18 02:50:58] < lament> i'm not sure. clog would talk more than an average regular :)
2020-04-27 02:05:41 <TrainCode> Wow...
2020-04-27 02:06:16 <pikhq> So, uh, given that you can probably find out a _lot_ of stuff about me if you're willing to pour over logs long enough :P
2020-04-27 02:06:36 <pikhq> Or, more accurately, about teenage-to-early-college me mostly
