2020-04-27 00:01:09 <Train> zzo38, I got the first part of the minsky engine working
2020-04-27 00:01:21 <Train> now i just need instruction handling
2020-04-27 00:09:19 <zzo38> OK
2020-04-27 00:13:54 <Train> https://esolangs.org/wiki/PATH is very similar to TrainCode
2020-04-27 00:30:57 <pikhq> Malbolge is kinda interesting just by way of picking the least convenient option for each and every design decision that came up.
2020-04-27 00:31:56 <pikhq> It's possible to make something more just straight-up weird I imagine, but I imagine not much less _useable_ without making serious sacrifices in theoretical capabilities.
2020-04-27 00:32:05 <Train> Yeah.

2020-04-27 01:41:36 <zzo38> Yes, I would think so. But you can still write, if you have something to write, I suppose.

2020-04-27 01:44:22 <TrainCode> So you can still have a conversation with them.

2020-04-27 01:47:31 * pikhq shall have to act as though people can read her words without being present
2020-04-27 01:48:34 <pikhq> I forgot this channel has people who catch up on goings-on while absent by reading the public logs xd
2020-04-27 01:48:39 <pikhq> It's been a while, admittedly
2020-04-27 01:48:46 <TrainCode> I do what.
2020-04-27 01:48:48 <TrainCode> *that.
2020-04-27 01:48:54 <TrainCode> Is that weird?
2020-04-27 01:52:39 <pikhq> No, it's actually culturally normal _here_. I think this is the only channel I've been in where it's all that common though.
2020-04-27 01:53:01 <TrainCode> hack.chat/?programming has it happen a lot
2020-04-27 01:53:14 * pikhq shrugs
2020-04-27 01:58:19 <fizzie> It's kind of uncommon on Freenode.
2020-04-27 01:58:42 <pikhq> I suppose it's not that surprising given the logs in the topic though
2020-04-27 01:58:52 <pikhq> Which has been a thing for... ages?
2020-04-27 01:59:15 <pikhq> Think that was there even back when I first joined. ... god, like 15 years ago
2020-04-27 02:00:13 <TrainCode> On hackchat, most people have some sort of logger bot.
2020-04-27 02:00:28 <TrainCode> Because the server doesn't store chatlogs.
2020-04-27 02:00:39 <pikhq> I connect via a bouncer these days

2020-04-27 02:02:29 <pikhq> The bouncer is being used for always-on and having shared client state between multiple systems, not for privacy reasons really
2020-04-27 02:02:53 <TrainCode> Okay.
2020-04-27 02:03:04 <zzo38> Freenode server doesn't store chat logs either I think; there is the bots to store the logs. (It is possible though to make a IRC server that does make public logs of public channels, although most don't.)
2020-04-27 02:03:28 <pikhq> Better not be for privacy, seeing as "pikhq" is what I go by basically everywhere and you can pretty trivially find where in the world I live and where I work from there :)
2020-04-27 02:04:26 <TrainCode> Hey, do you guys wanna talk on a hackchat?
2020-04-27 02:05:23 <fizzie> Ooh, we have indeed had public logs for quite awhile.

2020-04-27 02:45:31 <pikhq> Feeling like even more of a social recluse than usual while wanting to be more social than I had prior to about a year ago, personally.
2020-04-27 02:45:37 <pikhq> It's... kinda weird
2020-04-27 02:50:04 <shachaf> Yep, that's the "what you gotta do" part.
2020-04-27 02:50:16 * pikhq nods
2020-04-27 02:53:39 <zzo38> The switches I want in the "cat" program are not shared at all with what the GNU implementation does; the stuff that the GNU implementation does is stuff that it seem to me should be better in separate programs; the program "cat" would just concatenate files (and/or standard input) only. But, there is a few option I think should be put in, such as to tell what to do in case of errors reading and in case of errors writing.
2020-04-27 02:54:23 <pikhq> Hmm, those actually do seem somewhat more useful than the random transformations that GNU (and indeed, traditional Unix) cat can do
2020-04-27 03:00:29 <shachaf> The purpose of cat is to copy data from a file or file descriptor to stdout. Concatenating files is secondary.
2020-04-27 03:00:49 <shachaf> "purpose" according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIWID
2020-04-27 03:01:02 <pikhq> lmao, well, given thaaaat
2020-04-27 03:01:19 <imode> granted.
2020-04-27 03:01:32 <zzo38> Well, that is just the case where the number of files to concatenate is only one, which is of course a common case, and there is nothing wrong with that.

2020-04-27 03:09:43 <pikhq> In a certain way of looking at it, I suppose
2020-04-27 03:09:52 <pikhq> Just concatenating N files where N=1
2020-04-27 03:09:55 <pikhq> Seems trivial but hey
2020-04-27 03:13:39 <shachaf> How should this spawn function return values and errors?
2020-04-27 03:14:00 <shachaf> I just changed it to return a positive PID on success and a negative errno on failure.
2020-04-27 03:14:26 <pikhq> That seems reasonable enough, assuming your error results will fit in that
2020-04-27 03:22:25 <shachaf> I guess I'll stick with it.
2020-04-27 03:23:10 <shachaf> What about this file traversal API? How should it return errors?
2020-04-27 03:23:33 <pikhq> Assuming you're limited to C APIs, kinda hard
2020-04-27 03:23:42 <pikhq> There's a few options but none of them great
2020-04-27 03:23:50 <shachaf> Right now it's used like this: "NNFTW nnftw; nnftw_start(&nnftw, path, flags); while (nnftw_next(&nnftw)) { ...nnftw.path, etc.... }"
2020-04-27 03:24:23 <shachaf> There can be multiple errors as it fails to open directories and so on.
2020-04-27 03:25:13 <shachaf> I could make it return an error, as in, you have to check nnftw.err before using the file name, but it seems easy to forget about that.
2020-04-27 03:26:19 <zzo38> You can both set nnftw.err and then blank the file name too.
2020-04-27 03:26:26 <shachaf> I was thinking that by default it'll silently ignore errors, but you can pass in a flag saying that you want them, and then you have to check .err before using it.
2020-04-27 03:26:55 <zzo38> Some functions in SQLite that write the result to a pointer will write a null pointer when it returns an error (in addition to returning the error code, and saving it to be able to retrieve it later).
2020-04-27 03:27:16 <zzo38> shachaf: Yes, that will work, I think
2020-04-27 03:34:43 <pikhq> shachaf: I guess that works
2020-04-27 03:34:57 <pikhq> API design is hard.
2020-04-27 03:36:55 <shachaf> I'm not sure whether it's a good idea to skip errors silently by default.

2020-04-27 03:37:14 <shachaf> It's what nftw does (with no option to report errors), but maybe that's irrelevant.
2020-04-27 03:38:26 <pikhq> If this were a not-C language I'd say maybe return some option type, but uh... well.
2020-04-27 04:09:55 <shachaf> My file traversal program is 50-100% faster than `find` at printing all the files in /home. I would have expected find to be pretty fast at this task.

2020-04-27 09:48:56 <cpressey> I have an idea for an esolang
2020-04-27 09:49:47 <myname> what ide
2020-04-27 09:55:04 <cpressey> Concatenative version of the SK calculus. Doesn't need parentheses, then. But does need some extra combinators to manipulate the stack. Or maybe it's a queue instead of a stack and only has one extra combinator.

2020-04-27 09:59:36 <user24> cpressey: Like https://esolangs.org/wiki/Jot / https://esolangs.org/wiki/Zot ?
2020-04-27 10:04:39 <cpressey> I was thinking of something with a stack or a queue.
2020-04-27 10:07:10 <user24> So you have the combinator tree and a stack in the background? Interesting :)
2020-04-27 10:11:24 <user24> For some reason reminds me of a distributed computing paradigm in which intermediate results are put into a shared pool and then taken out by another process
2020-04-27 10:13:54 <b_jonas> cpressey: look at lambda: the gathering. no parenthesis.
2020-04-27 10:16:46 <b_jonas> also didn't you just make such an esolang a few months ago, and I pointed you to LTG at that point too?

2020-04-27 13:28:53 <fizzie> The access of a[-1] sounds fixable by making the latter loop `for(;++c<256;)` which would also be one character shorter than `for(;c<256;c++)`.
2020-04-27 13:29:15 <int-e> a[257],c;main(){while(c=getchar()+1)a[c]++;while(c<257)a[c]--?putchar(c-1):c++;}
2020-04-27 13:29:27 <int-e> is it possible to squeeze it all into a single loop?
2020-04-27 13:30:01 <int-e> well, it's possible of course, but is it worthwhile in terms of size?
2020-04-27 13:33:07 <int-e> oh there's this trick, too: a[257];main(c){while(c=getchar()+1)a[c]++;while(c<257)a[c]--?putchar(c-1):c++;}
2020-04-27 13:33:31 <kspalaiologos> damn :p
2020-04-27 13:33:37 <kspalaiologos> I forgot about it
2020-04-27 13:34:32 <kspalaiologos> a[257];main(c){for(c=getchar()+1;a[c]++);while(c<257)a[c]--?putchar(c-1):c++;}
2020-04-27 13:34:35 <kspalaiologos> this is even smaller
2020-04-27 13:34:46 <kspalaiologos> wait: nope doesn't work
2020-04-27 13:34:47 <int-e> kspalaiologos: but doesn't work
2020-04-27 13:35:01 <kspalaiologos> need one more semicolon
2020-04-27 13:35:07 <kspalaiologos> then it's equal size :p
2020-04-27 13:35:18 <int-e> there's no point in replacing while(cond) by for(;cond;) unless you actually use those empty blocks for something.
2020-04-27 13:36:06 <kspalaiologos> yeah true
2020-04-27 13:37:39 <int-e> myname: it's a fine line... but out of bounds access can easily cause the program to misbehave, since you're relying on values of uninitialized (possibly not even present) memory.
2020-04-27 13:43:05 <FireFly> hmm
2020-04-27 13:43:45 <FireFly> how about  a[c]--?putchar(c-1):c++;  ->  a[c++]--&&putchar(--c);  to save one byte?
2020-04-27 13:44:16 <int-e> FireFly: cute idea, but it's off by one
2020-04-27 13:44:23 <FireFly> oh bummer
2020-04-27 13:44:37 <FireFly> oh yeah
2020-04-27 13:44:49 <FireFly> it'd have to be (c-=2) and then it doesn't save you anything
2020-04-27 13:46:02 <FireFly> wait, not quite.. but yeah, off-by-one in the output
2020-04-27 13:47:55 <b_jonas> `olist 1201

2020-04-27 13:49:55 * int-e wonders how kspalaiologos feels about this kind of undefined behavior: a[257];main(d,c){for(;d<257;)c?a[c=getchar()+1]++:a[d]--?putchar(d-1):d++;}
2020-04-27 13:50:08 <kspalaiologos> I'm always up for UB
2020-04-27 13:50:28 <int-e> (and reliance on argc being 1)
2020-04-27 13:50:45 <kspalaiologos> it makes code "interesting"

2020-04-27 13:52:44 <int-e> but in any case, putting it all into a single loop seems to pay off.
2020-04-27 13:53:53 <int-e> there, a bit cleaner: a[257],d;main(c){while(d<256)c?a[c=getchar()+1]++:a[d+1]--?putchar(d):d++;}
2020-04-27 13:55:05 <int-e> wait, what exactly is wrong with FireFly's trick then...
2020-04-27 13:55:18 <FireFly> int-e: it should be --c-1
2020-04-27 13:55:44 <FireFly> I accounted for the ++ with a -- but didn't account for the off-by-one in the value actually passed to putchar
2020-04-27 13:56:09 <int-e> yeah, but I changed something and now it applies: //a[257],d;main(c){while(d<256)c?a[c=getchar()+1]++:a[d+1]--?putchar(d):d++;}
2020-04-27 13:56:14 <int-e> uh
2020-04-27 13:56:18 <int-e> a[257],d;main(c){while(d<256)c?a[c=getchar()+1]++:a[++d]--&&putchar(--d);}

2020-04-27 15:03:21 <cpressey> I give up on my idea. Applicative languages something something concatenative languages something combinators something combinators something, that's my reason for why it doesn't work.
2020-04-27 15:05:44 <int-e> cpressey: if you want to do linear programming, you should go into math instead of computer science *runs*
2020-04-27 15:08:12 * cpressey tries to work out the basis for that joke

2020-04-27 15:09:22 <int-e> I did it for the pun.

2020-04-27 15:11:14 <cpressey> Oh, I thought it might be because I had so many unknowns in my statement.
2020-04-27 15:11:54 <cpressey> That's also why I used 'basis'
2020-04-27 15:11:56 <int-e> Unknowns... maybe in isolation, but I had too much context for that, I think.
2020-04-27 15:12:21 <int-e> Oh, darn. I missed the "basis".
2020-04-27 15:13:41 <int-e> Which is pretty good in connection with the simplex algorithm (which is about identifying the right basis to make optimality obvious).

2020-04-27 22:39:20 <orbitaldecay> anybody know of any other esolangs that would make interesting OSes?
2020-04-27 22:39:27 <orbitaldecay> I've got a framework now, might as well use it
2020-04-27 22:39:35 <zzo38> I am not sure.
2020-04-27 22:39:51 <orbitaldecay> anything with a repl would work really
2020-04-27 22:41:04 <orbitaldecay> it'd be cool to have a bootable iso that could multiboot a variety of esolang OSes
2020-04-27 22:41:11 User Name: myname = myname!~myname@ks300980.kimsufi.com
2020-04-27 22:41:11 <myname> what does you os different from an interpreter besides the ability to boot into it?
2020-04-27 22:41:45 <orbitaldecay> ring-0 access, so the ability to play with the hardware and full access to the cpu and ram
2020-04-27 22:42:01 <orbitaldecay> but for most uses, no major difference
2020-04-27 22:42:11 <orbitaldecay> would just be funny to write device drivers in brainfuck
2020-04-27 22:42:31 User Name: b_jonas = b_jonas!~x@176.63.12.50
2020-04-27 22:42:31 <b_jonas> orbitaldecay: so like easier to accidentally lose all your data with an OS
2020-04-27 22:42:32 <myname> for various degrees of fun
2020-04-27 22:42:55 <myname> but i don't see why you'd need a repl
2020-04-27 22:42:56 <orbitaldecay> b_jonas: indeed. virtualbox is probably a smart way to go.
2020-04-27 22:43:02 <myname> just make an inbuilt editor
2020-04-27 22:43:02 <b_jonas> because there's no OS layer to enforce permissions on your user process
2020-04-27 22:43:30 <orbitaldecay> you're saying that like it's a bad thing ;)
2020-04-27 22:43:53 <b_jonas> some people consider it a good thing
2020-04-27 22:44:09 <myname> having an editor and an interpreter would open your framework up to all ascii based 2d languages
2020-04-27 22:44:37 <orbitaldecay> myname: that's an interesting idea
2020-04-27 22:44:47 <myname> i'd rather write a device driver in befunge than in brainfuck
2020-04-27 22:45:30 <orbitaldecay> brb
2020-04-27 22:56:46 <pikhq> In principal you could have a standalone booting Brainfuck environment, but I foresee it being very difficult to do usefully.

2020-04-27 23:03:29 <fizzie> There's also the https://www.bedroomlan.org/hardware/fungus/ if you wanted to design some hardware where that sort of thing would make more sense.
2020-04-27 23:05:37 <fizzie> There was a CPU design course at the university where the main project was a MIPS CPU, but you could've gotten some extra points for adding a coprocessor of any kind, and we did think about doing a Befunge one but couldn't be bothered.
2020-04-27 23:06:44 <fizzie> FWIW, any sort of "Befunge with subroutines" variant would probably be pretty practical as a basis for an environment. It's not particularly dissimilar from Forth, which people do use for that sort of thing.
