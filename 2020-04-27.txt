2020-04-27 00:01:09 <Train> zzo38, I got the first part of the minsky engine working
2020-04-27 00:01:21 <Train> now i just need instruction handling
2020-04-27 00:09:19 <zzo38> OK
2020-04-27 00:13:54 <Train> https://esolangs.org/wiki/PATH is very similar to TrainCode
2020-04-27 00:30:57 <pikhq> Malbolge is kinda interesting just by way of picking the least convenient option for each and every design decision that came up.
2020-04-27 00:31:56 <pikhq> It's possible to make something more just straight-up weird I imagine, but I imagine not much less _useable_ without making serious sacrifices in theoretical capabilities.
2020-04-27 00:32:05 <Train> Yeah.

2020-04-27 01:35:23 <pikhq> hum
2020-04-27 01:35:41 <pikhq> hard to have a conversation with someone who isn't here, isn't it? :P

2020-04-27 01:41:36 <zzo38> Yes, I would think so. But you can still write, if you have something to write, I suppose.
2020-04-27 01:42:56 User Name: TrainCode = TrainCode!ca9a8601@202-154-134-1.ubs-dynamic.connections.net.nz
2020-04-27 01:42:56 <TrainCode> And we can see what you have said through the logs.
2020-04-27 01:44:22 <TrainCode> So you can still have a conversation with them.
2020-04-27 01:44:38 <TrainCode> _test_
2020-04-27 01:46:53 <pikhq> lmao
2020-04-27 01:46:59 <pikhq> yeah, i suppose that's true
2020-04-27 01:47:31 * pikhq shall have to act as though people can read her words without being present
2020-04-27 01:48:34 <pikhq> I forgot this channel has people who catch up on goings-on while absent by reading the public logs xd
2020-04-27 01:48:39 <pikhq> It's been a while, admittedly
2020-04-27 01:48:46 <TrainCode> I do what.
2020-04-27 01:48:48 <TrainCode> *that.
2020-04-27 01:48:54 <TrainCode> Is that weird?
2020-04-27 01:52:39 <pikhq> No, it's actually culturally normal _here_. I think this is the only channel I've been in where it's all that common though.
2020-04-27 01:53:01 <TrainCode> hack.chat/?programming has it happen a lot
2020-04-27 01:53:14 * pikhq shrugs
2020-04-27 01:58:19 <fizzie> It's kind of uncommon on Freenode.
2020-04-27 01:58:42 <pikhq> I suppose it's not that surprising given the logs in the topic though
2020-04-27 01:58:52 <pikhq> Which has been a thing for... ages?
2020-04-27 01:59:15 <pikhq> Think that was there even back when I first joined. ... god, like 15 years ago
