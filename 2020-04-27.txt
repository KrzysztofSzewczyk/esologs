2020-04-27 00:01:09 <Train> zzo38, I got the first part of the minsky engine working
2020-04-27 00:01:21 <Train> now i just need instruction handling
2020-04-27 00:09:19 <zzo38> OK
2020-04-27 00:13:54 <Train> https://esolangs.org/wiki/PATH is very similar to TrainCode
2020-04-27 00:30:57 <pikhq> Malbolge is kinda interesting just by way of picking the least convenient option for each and every design decision that came up.
2020-04-27 00:31:56 <pikhq> It's possible to make something more just straight-up weird I imagine, but I imagine not much less _useable_ without making serious sacrifices in theoretical capabilities.
2020-04-27 00:32:05 <Train> Yeah.

2020-04-27 01:41:36 <zzo38> Yes, I would think so. But you can still write, if you have something to write, I suppose.

2020-04-27 01:44:22 <TrainCode> So you can still have a conversation with them.

2020-04-27 01:47:31 * pikhq shall have to act as though people can read her words without being present
2020-04-27 01:48:34 <pikhq> I forgot this channel has people who catch up on goings-on while absent by reading the public logs xd
2020-04-27 01:48:39 <pikhq> It's been a while, admittedly
2020-04-27 01:48:46 <TrainCode> I do what.
2020-04-27 01:48:48 <TrainCode> *that.
2020-04-27 01:48:54 <TrainCode> Is that weird?
2020-04-27 01:52:39 <pikhq> No, it's actually culturally normal _here_. I think this is the only channel I've been in where it's all that common though.
2020-04-27 01:53:01 <TrainCode> hack.chat/?programming has it happen a lot
2020-04-27 01:53:14 * pikhq shrugs
2020-04-27 01:58:19 <fizzie> It's kind of uncommon on Freenode.
2020-04-27 01:58:42 <pikhq> I suppose it's not that surprising given the logs in the topic though
2020-04-27 01:58:52 <pikhq> Which has been a thing for... ages?
2020-04-27 01:59:15 <pikhq> Think that was there even back when I first joined. ... god, like 15 years ago
2020-04-27 02:00:13 <TrainCode> On hackchat, most people have some sort of logger bot.
2020-04-27 02:00:28 <TrainCode> Because the server doesn't store chatlogs.
2020-04-27 02:00:39 <pikhq> I connect via a bouncer these days

2020-04-27 02:02:29 <pikhq> The bouncer is being used for always-on and having shared client state between multiple systems, not for privacy reasons really
2020-04-27 02:02:53 <TrainCode> Okay.
2020-04-27 02:03:04 <zzo38> Freenode server doesn't store chat logs either I think; there is the bots to store the logs. (It is possible though to make a IRC server that does make public logs of public channels, although most don't.)
2020-04-27 02:03:28 <pikhq> Better not be for privacy, seeing as "pikhq" is what I go by basically everywhere and you can pretty trivially find where in the world I live and where I work from there :)
2020-04-27 02:04:26 <TrainCode> Hey, do you guys wanna talk on a hackchat?
2020-04-27 02:05:23 <fizzie> Ooh, we have indeed had public logs for quite awhile.

2020-04-27 02:35:12 <shachaf> hi
2020-04-27 02:36:12 <pikhq> how's things? aside from the world at large being scow, of course

2020-04-27 02:45:31 <pikhq> Feeling like even more of a social recluse than usual while wanting to be more social than I had prior to about a year ago, personally.
2020-04-27 02:45:37 <pikhq> It's... kinda weird
2020-04-27 02:50:04 <shachaf> Yep, that's the "what you gotta do" part.
2020-04-27 02:50:16 * pikhq nods
2020-04-27 02:53:39 <zzo38> The switches I want in the "cat" program are not shared at all with what the GNU implementation does; the stuff that the GNU implementation does is stuff that it seem to me should be better in separate programs; the program "cat" would just concatenate files (and/or standard input) only. But, there is a few option I think should be put in, such as to tell what to do in case of errors reading and in case of errors writing.
2020-04-27 02:54:23 <pikhq> Hmm, those actually do seem somewhat more useful than the random transformations that GNU (and indeed, traditional Unix) cat can do
2020-04-27 03:00:29 <shachaf> The purpose of cat is to copy data from a file or file descriptor to stdout. Concatenating files is secondary.
2020-04-27 03:00:49 <shachaf> "purpose" according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIWID
2020-04-27 03:01:02 <pikhq> lmao, well, given thaaaat
2020-04-27 03:01:19 <imode> granted.
2020-04-27 03:01:32 <zzo38> Well, that is just the case where the number of files to concatenate is only one, which is of course a common case, and there is nothing wrong with that.

2020-04-27 03:09:43 <pikhq> In a certain way of looking at it, I suppose
2020-04-27 03:09:52 <pikhq> Just concatenating N files where N=1
2020-04-27 03:09:55 <pikhq> Seems trivial but hey
2020-04-27 03:13:39 <shachaf> How should this spawn function return values and errors?
2020-04-27 03:14:00 <shachaf> I just changed it to return a positive PID on success and a negative errno on failure.
2020-04-27 03:14:26 <pikhq> That seems reasonable enough, assuming your error results will fit in that
2020-04-27 03:22:25 <shachaf> I guess I'll stick with it.
2020-04-27 03:23:10 <shachaf> What about this file traversal API? How should it return errors?
2020-04-27 03:23:33 <pikhq> Assuming you're limited to C APIs, kinda hard
2020-04-27 03:23:42 <pikhq> There's a few options but none of them great
2020-04-27 03:23:50 <shachaf> Right now it's used like this: "NNFTW nnftw; nnftw_start(&nnftw, path, flags); while (nnftw_next(&nnftw)) { ...nnftw.path, etc.... }"
2020-04-27 03:24:23 <shachaf> There can be multiple errors as it fails to open directories and so on.
2020-04-27 03:25:13 <shachaf> I could make it return an error, as in, you have to check nnftw.err before using the file name, but it seems easy to forget about that.
2020-04-27 03:26:19 <zzo38> You can both set nnftw.err and then blank the file name too.
2020-04-27 03:26:26 <shachaf> I was thinking that by default it'll silently ignore errors, but you can pass in a flag saying that you want them, and then you have to check .err before using it.
2020-04-27 03:26:55 <zzo38> Some functions in SQLite that write the result to a pointer will write a null pointer when it returns an error (in addition to returning the error code, and saving it to be able to retrieve it later).
2020-04-27 03:27:16 <zzo38> shachaf: Yes, that will work, I think
2020-04-27 03:34:43 <pikhq> shachaf: I guess that works
2020-04-27 03:34:57 <pikhq> API design is hard.
2020-04-27 03:36:55 <shachaf> I'm not sure whether it's a good idea to skip errors silently by default.

2020-04-27 03:37:14 <shachaf> It's what nftw does (with no option to report errors), but maybe that's irrelevant.
2020-04-27 03:38:26 <pikhq> If this were a not-C language I'd say maybe return some option type, but uh... well.
2020-04-27 04:09:55 <shachaf> My file traversal program is 50-100% faster than `find` at printing all the files in /home. I would have expected find to be pretty fast at this task.
