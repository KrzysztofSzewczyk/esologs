2020-05-10 00:55:37 <imode> working on a token-based rewriting language that has some vague resemblance to concatenative languages.
2020-05-10 00:55:59 <imode> with native support for lists, anything is possible.
2020-05-10 00:57:52 <imode> https://hatebin.com/ssyfkqowua
2020-05-10 01:00:19 <imode> while loops are proving tricky with the "infix" syntax.
2020-05-10 01:01:15 <imode> if/else was also tricky. it assumes a default evaluation order of right to left. writing it to be direction agnostic is kind of the next goal.
2020-05-10 01:03:02 <imode> if rdrop is evaluated before rswap, for example, you'll end up swapping two unrelated values on the right-hand side, and that'll be messy if anything else is beyond that context.

2020-05-10 03:25:10 <moony> imode: that language looks fun
2020-05-10 03:25:22 <moony> and frankly I like the syntax, so I think i'm going to steal it for my own use
2020-05-10 03:25:24 * moony runs
2020-05-10 03:27:30 <moony> for less esoteric purposes, mind you
2020-05-10 03:45:53 <int-e> that vaguely reminds me of that one time I tried TCL.
2020-05-10 03:46:05 <int-e> (because of the many square brackets)
2020-05-10 03:47:03 <pikhq> yay, Tcl

2020-05-10 03:48:53 <zzo38> Have you tried to program in PostScript one time, though? (Apparently, even the inventor of INTERCAL uses PostScript.)
2020-05-10 03:50:05 <b_jonas> zzo38: I think you read the M:tG comprule updates. If I cast a Migratory Greathorn and choose to mutate an opponent's creature with it, then who controls the triggered ability triggered from the Greathorn?
2020-05-10 03:52:45 <zzo38> The spell has to have the same owner as the creature you choose to mutate, I think. So unless the opponent's creature is owned by the same player as the spell (e.g. because your opponent took control of your creature), you can't cast that spell like that.
2020-05-10 03:53:30 <zzo38> However, to answer your question, let's see the Migratory Greathorn card, first.
2020-05-10 03:56:00 <zzo38> OK, rule 702.139d merely says "An ability that triggers whenever a creature mutates triggers when a spell merges with a creature as a result of a resolving mutating creature spell." I think it triggers after it is on the battlefield, so your opponent controls that ability, but you get to decide to put it on the top or bottom.
2020-05-10 03:56:25 <zzo38> (If someone knows to the contrary, you can tell me, but I think it works like how I mentioned.)
2020-05-10 04:02:31 <b_jonas> zzo38: yeah, there's a requirement that the parts of the mutated creature has to have the same owner, so this doesn't come up too often, but there are lots of effects to take control of a creature
2020-05-10 04:03:08 <zzo38> I realized something, which is that if you are using my "generalized mutate" rule but only using official cards (maybe because it is a kind of Constructed game with both custom and official cards, but neither player decided to use any custom cards), nevertheless it has an effect on the game, because it is now possible to use Artificial Evolution to prevent a creature from mutating.
2020-05-10 04:04:18 <zzo38> b_jonas: Yes. I wrote what is the best I can tell from reading the rules.
2020-05-10 04:04:22 <b_jonas> heck, it's not even quite clear to me from the rules who will control the merged creature after you mutate, and whether the order of the cards depends for that
2020-05-10 04:04:32 <b_jonas> ouch
2020-05-10 04:05:23 <zzo38> I believe it will have the same controller as the original, because who controls a permanent is a continuous property, and continuous effects continue to apply.
2020-05-10 04:09:42 <zzo38> (Rule 721.2c specifically says that continuous effects continue to apply.)
2020-05-10 04:10:29 <b_jonas> zzo38: I don't know, there might not be a continuous effect if the original creature is a card that was put otb under the opponent's control, such as with Gruesome Encore.
2020-05-10 04:11:34 <zzo38> I think that since it is a continuous property, it is still a continuous effect, although not a static effect.
2020-05-10 04:12:04 <zzo38> Although, I am unsure.
2020-05-10 04:13:28 <b_jonas> yeah, 721.2c says that the merged object is the same object as the permanent that already existed
2020-05-10 04:14:22 <zzo38> However, I think that if (hypothetically) some static ability says "you control all blue permanents", and the mutation changes it to not blue, then since the mutation is a layer 1 effect and control is a layer 2 effect, this means that control effect will no longer apply (and Thoughtlace won't allow you to take it back, since that is a layer 5 effect).
2020-05-10 04:15:26 <b_jonas> "you control all blue permanents" is a very unlikely effect, but sure
2020-05-10 04:16:03 <zzo38> Yes, it is unlikely, but I was giving a hypothetical example.
2020-05-10 04:18:21 <b_jonas> I should ask efnet/#mtgrules probably
2020-05-10 04:19:00 <zzo38> Yes, perhaps they know better than I do.
2020-05-10 04:19:14 <b_jonas> that or the scryfall web forum
2020-05-10 04:19:36 <b_jonas> oh, but I should re-read the release notes first
2020-05-10 04:20:04 <zzo38> Yes, maybe they answered the question for you
2020-05-10 04:28:31 <zzo38> Do you like my "Master Shuffler" and "Malaclypse the Younger" Un-cards?
2020-05-10 04:29:55 <b_jonas> I don't know, I haven't looked at your cards lately, especially not your un-cards
2020-05-10 04:30:48 <zzo38> Master Shuffler shuffles players, planeswalkers, mana pools, your hand, planar decks, scheme decks, time stamps, and the layer system.
2020-05-10 04:31:03 <zzo38> Malaclypse the Younger makes all intervening if clauses true.
2020-05-10 04:36:58 <b_jonas> zzo38: efnet/#magicjudges-rules tells me that the opponent keeps control of the permanent when it merges with a mutate card
2020-05-10 04:37:17 <b_jonas> and that they'll also control the "whenever this creature mutates" ability
2020-05-10 04:37:43 <b_jonas> so if an opponent owns my treefolk, I can mutate it with a Greathorn and they'll have to shuffle
2020-05-10 04:38:51 <zzo38> Yes, that is what I thought.
2020-05-10 04:39:07 <zzo38> Now I am more certain of it, because they said the same thing.
2020-05-10 04:46:29 <imode> moony: feel free to steal lol.
2020-05-10 04:46:57 <imode> it's an inconvenient little language because you don't have a separation between code and data.
