2019-11-02 00:23:07 <shachaf> Are pointers signed or unsigned?
2019-11-02 00:23:42 <olsner> they could be
2019-11-02 00:24:42 <shachaf> How should I think of them?
2019-11-02 00:24:50 <olsner> what does it actually mean though? when do you have sign/zero-extension of pointers where you could tell the difference?
2019-11-02 00:26:00 <olsner> I do like to think that x86-64 has signed pointers the way they're usually used (with kernel space in negative addresses)
2019-11-02 00:29:43 <shachaf> Right, that's the sort of thing I was thinking.
2019-11-02 00:29:49 <shachaf> Maybe it makes no difference.

2019-11-02 00:32:20 <oerjan> . o O ( the difference is negative )
2019-11-02 00:33:10 <int-e> shachaf: signs are pointers, so pointers should be signed, is that what you mean?
2019-11-02 00:33:42 <shachaf> Exactly.
2019-11-02 00:33:52 <shachaf> But then what are cosigns?
2019-11-02 00:34:26 <int-e> They are orthogonal to signs.
2019-11-02 00:34:56 <shachaf> 17:	76 06                	jbe    1f <foo+0x1f>
2019-11-02 00:34:59 <shachaf> So confusil.
2019-11-02 00:35:27 <shachaf> I just learned about gas "1f" label syntax a few days ago, and I kept thinking it was a 0x1f offset.
2019-11-02 00:35:34 <shachaf> This time it actually is a 0x1f offset!
2019-11-02 00:35:43 <int-e> :)
2019-11-02 00:36:17 <shachaf> (To be fair, this is objdump output, so it wouldn't use the 1f syntax.)
2019-11-02 00:37:18 <int-e> To this day I find it confusing that the offset of relative jumps is relative to the address following the current instruction.
2019-11-02 00:37:37 <int-e> 0x19 + 0x06 = 0x1f
2019-11-02 00:37:55 <shachaf> Yes.
2019-11-02 00:38:20 <shachaf> In particular I was trying to figure out a jump target in gdb a few days and I computed it relative to $rip without thinking.
2019-11-02 00:38:42 <shachaf> No, not a jump target, rip-relative addressing.
2019-11-02 00:39:01 <int-e> It makes sense, of course (the instruction has been decoded, and correspondingly, the IP advanced, when the jump happens)
2019-11-02 00:39:28 <int-e> (thinking in terms of *very* old processors like 8086)
2019-11-02 00:40:29 <shachaf> Sure.
2019-11-02 00:41:54 <shachaf> Is rip-relative addressing the same way? I guess it must be but I've already forgotten.
2019-11-02 00:42:33 <int-e> yes it is.
2019-11-02 00:43:03 <shachaf> Yep, I just checked.
2019-11-02 00:43:23 <shachaf> I should know this since I implemented most of the addressing modes recently.
2019-11-02 00:43:54 <shachaf> Though not some of the weird ones like 64-bit (%eax).
2019-11-02 00:43:57 <shachaf> Does anyone use that?
2019-11-02 00:44:20 <int-e> Actually I think so.

2019-11-02 00:44:58 <int-e> Having 32bit pointers is still attractive to conserve memory.
2019-11-02 00:45:24 <shachaf> But you can use them with 64-bit registers, can't you?
2019-11-02 00:45:43 <int-e> Yes.
2019-11-02 00:45:44 <olsner> since you get zero-extension for most operations, you can usually just use %rax with a 32-bit address and save a byte
2019-11-02 00:45:51 <shachaf> At least if you write something like mov foo, %eax; mov (%rax), bar
2019-11-02 00:46:24 <shachaf> I wonder, is %eax sign-extended when you use (%eax)?
2019-11-02 00:46:27 <shachaf> I imagine not.
2019-11-02 00:46:46 <int-e> But I can make up reasons... getting proper overflow behavior for (%eax + 4*%esi + 0xbase)....
2019-11-02 00:47:17 <olsner> but what would use something like that in 64-bit code?
2019-11-02 00:47:55 <shachaf> When do you want overflow behavior for addresses?
2019-11-02 00:48:07 <int-e> olsner: I *would* hope that this is a purely theoretical reason :)
2019-11-02 00:48:18 <olsner> but an interesting side-effect if the address size affects all of the address calculation or just the size of the input registers
2019-11-02 00:49:15 <int-e> Clearly I expect that it affects the whole computation.

2019-11-02 00:54:37 <olsner> possible dumb reason: someone planned/built a 32-bit x86 emulator (before compatibility mode was invented?) and convinced AMD to provide support for extra-stupid JIT compilers that just add prefixes to specific instructions

2019-11-02 00:55:42 <olsner> for having the 32-bit override
2019-11-02 00:55:58 <int-e> ah.
2019-11-02 00:56:11 <int-e> plausible enough
2019-11-02 00:57:11 <int-e> I also bet this was rather cheap to support.
2019-11-02 00:58:16 <int-e> In context... which is a CPU that supports real mode (which has 32 bit addressing mode via the address size prefix) and 32 bit mode support for legacy software.

2019-11-02 01:30:30 <shachaf> It was somewhat annoying to track down.
2019-11-02 02:08:38 <kmc> what bizarro mode are you talking about
2019-11-02 02:08:58 <kmc> the base + mult*index + offset mode is pretty reasonable, aside from the gas syntax for it
2019-11-02 02:09:44 <kmc> with Intel syntax it'd be like  MOV EDI, DWORD PTR [4*EAX + EDX + 7]
2019-11-02 02:09:51 <kmc> or what have you
2019-11-02 02:09:53 <shachaf> Sure, but you have addr32, fs/gs, rip-relative, all sorts of things.

2019-11-02 02:12:03 <shachaf> gotta include that sib byte for r12
2019-11-02 02:12:46 <shachaf> Of course I haven't done SSE/AVX/whatever at all, or the VEX prefix, or anything like that.

2019-11-02 02:15:02 <shachaf> what instruction encoding are you into
2019-11-02 02:15:55 <fizzie> It doesn't even have a bit-reversed addressing mode.
2019-11-02 02:16:30 <shachaf> What's that?
2019-11-02 02:16:40 <fizzie> It's a thing DSPs have, for speeding up FFTs.
2019-11-02 02:16:59 <fizzie> The TI TMS320C54x at least has it.

2019-11-02 02:17:21 <kmc> oh?
2019-11-02 02:17:35 <shachaf> But I think that one is modrm+offset rather than modrm+SIB.
2019-11-02 02:17:44 <shachaf> fizzie: That sounds pretty fancy. I should learn about fancy DSP things.
2019-11-02 02:17:59 <fizzie> They also have circular addressing modes.
2019-11-02 02:18:06 <fizzie> For FIR filters and suchlike.
2019-11-02 02:18:47 <shachaf> Speaking of circles, what's the nicest way to write a circular buffer?
2019-11-02 02:18:56 <shachaf> I don't like having a boolean to distinguish empty from full.
2019-11-02 02:19:30 <fizzie> You can go with head + length instead of head + tail.
2019-11-02 02:19:43 <fizzie> Then you have 0 and N for empty and full.
2019-11-02 02:20:14 <shachaf> Hmm, I guess.
2019-11-02 02:20:23 <fizzie> There's also that one fancy thing that I think Chrome used somewhere, or someone used somewhere.
2019-11-02 02:20:25 <shachaf> What about the case where you have a separate reader and writer?
2019-11-02 02:20:33 <shachaf> I know of some other tricks:
2019-11-02 02:20:48 <shachaf> Map two copies of the same buffer in adjacent address space, so you get a contiguous buffer.
2019-11-02 02:20:52 <fizzie> The Bip-Buffer, that's what I was thinking of.
2019-11-02 02:21:01 <fizzie> The Bip-Buffer doesn't need the mapping trick.
2019-11-02 02:21:29 <fizzie> (On the other hand, it may waste some space.)
2019-11-02 02:22:30 <shachaf> Another trick I heard about is, instead of keeping the read/written size mod the buffer size, keep the total size, and mask it at use time.
2019-11-02 02:22:40 <kmc> bip booper
2019-11-02 02:24:48 <fizzie> I can't find any reference to anyone actually using the bip-buffer, just a few random implementations, so maybe I imagined that.
2019-11-02 02:25:06 <shachaf> I'm reading about it now.
2019-11-02 02:25:09 <fizzie> spsc-bip-buffer is "#108 in Concurrency" on lib.rs, which sounds like a TripAdvisor ranking.
2019-11-02 02:26:44 <shachaf> This explanation doesn't seem very clear.
2019-11-02 02:28:28 <shachaf> What's the benefit of this?
2019-11-02 02:28:49 <kmc> what is lib.rs
2019-11-02 02:28:59 <shachaf> Is it that writes are always contiguous (but reads might not be)?

2019-11-02 02:42:13 <fizzie> AIUI, the reads are contiguous too.
2019-11-02 02:43:40 <shachaf> Maybe I don't understand the diagram in https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/3479/The-Bip-Buffer-The-Circular-Buffer-with-a-Twist
2019-11-02 02:44:06 <shachaf> What happens in 5? From their description it looks like both A and B contain data.
2019-11-02 02:44:35 <fizzie> Right, reads of multiple writes are not necessarily contiguous.
2019-11-02 02:45:01 <fizzie> Maybe.
2019-11-02 02:45:13 <shachaf> Hmm.
2019-11-02 02:45:31 <shachaf> I guess the idea is that a library might want to write a fixed-size thing and you want to make sure to be able to fit it in the buffer?
2019-11-02 02:45:44 <shachaf> And another library can also interpret that fixed-size thing since it's contiguous.
2019-11-02 02:46:33 <shachaf> (Or, y'know, non-fixed-size.)
2019-11-02 02:46:38 <fizzie> Or, no, maybe reads of any size can be contiguous too, it's just that in stage 5 if you wanted to read more than the orange bit some copying would be involved.
2019-11-02 02:46:51 <fizzie> ...or maybe not.
2019-11-02 02:47:32 <shachaf> As in copying all the data in the buffer?
2019-11-02 02:47:37 <fizzie> Yeah, I was looking at the API, for reading you just ask the thing for the largest contiguous block.
2019-11-02 02:47:38 <shachaf> Regular circular buffers have this property too.
2019-11-02 02:47:44 <shachaf> Which API?
2019-11-02 02:48:05 <fizzie> Well, the BipBuffer class described there.
2019-11-02 02:48:21 <fizzie> But I guess it's still useful, if you (say) put length-delimited protos there.
2019-11-02 02:48:29 <shachaf> Oh, the one on that page.
2019-11-02 02:48:51 <shachaf> I guess that's true?
2019-11-02 02:48:56 <fizzie> As long as you write the thing into one contiguous (reserved) block, the reading side can also read it as one contiguous block.
2019-11-02 02:49:09 <shachaf> Right.
2019-11-02 02:49:24 <shachaf> Maybe it would be better for APIs to support reading and writing in multiple chunks.
2019-11-02 02:49:45 <fizzie> Maybe.
2019-11-02 02:49:46 <shachaf> I guess there's some concern that the API will want to keep an internal buffer and do some copying in order to support that.
2019-11-02 02:50:28 <shachaf> I think the mmap solution is better if you want things to be contiguous.

2019-11-02 04:32:45 <imode> using the thought I had earlier, you can build interesting data pipelines.
2019-11-02 04:33:14 <imode> sum $1234 bitvector
2019-11-02 04:33:45 <imode> or sum bitvector $1234 number
2019-11-02 04:34:30 <imode> because you push a handle to the concurrent process to the queue, any further processes can be constructed, passed that handle, and form a linear dataflow graph.
2019-11-02 04:35:46 <imode> a bidirectional one as well. `number` takes a number and a process to send that value to. `bitvector` takes a process, receives a number and sends the bits of that number to the taken process. `sum` takes a process, receives a number and keeps a running tally of that number which is available on request.
2019-11-02 04:35:55 <imode> you can do lazy evaluation with that.
2019-11-02 04:37:04 <imode> you can design a process that takes two handles, receives something and broadcasts it to the two processes it has handles to.
2019-11-02 05:01:36 <imode> https://hatebin.com/shiyqdhisf not bad.
2019-11-02 05:04:17 <imode> bitvector's logic is wrong, it should send zero on completion.
2019-11-02 05:07:42 <imode> https://hatebin.com/lriwwfiijo that's better.
2019-11-02 05:09:16 <imode> I feel like you can get pretty granular with this.

2019-11-02 13:24:21 <b_jonas> kspalaiologos: I beg to differ, but I can write usable parsers from scratch. just don't look at my ancient psz interpreter. that was long ago, and I've matured since.
2019-11-02 13:26:13 <b_jonas> "<kspalaiologos> I shouldn't have slept at math lessons" => meh, it's quite possible that many of your lessons were a waste of time. get some good books and learn from them instead.
2019-11-02 13:27:34 <b_jonas> "<shachaf> Are pointers signed or unsigned?" => I don't think that distinction makes sense there. you don't high-multiply pointers, or compare pointers from two different arrays
2019-11-02 13:29:13 <b_jonas> but if I have to choose, they're probably signed on x86_64 (because the top bits are usually the same unless you have a future cpu with a 2**64 bit long address space), unsigned on x86_16 (because they are mapped into x86_32's address space by zero filling),

2019-11-02 13:35:27 <b_jonas> shikhin: for x86_32 though, signed vs unsigned does make a difference, and I don't know which one is used. either look it up in the ELF ABI docs, or allocate a 2.5 GB sized array (for which you need either an x86_64 kernel, or an x86_32 kernel configured to the slower 3GB+1GB address space split rather than the default 2GB+2GB split) and see how it's layed out and how pointers in it compare

2019-11-02 13:43:18 <b_jonas> "<shachaf> Maybe it would be better for APIs to support reading and writing in multiple chunks." => they already do, if you mean multiple chunks in memory assembled to a single chunk in the file descriptor or back, with preadv/pwritev, plus the aio api eg. aio_write is parametrized like that by default (I wanted to say "works like that by default" but it's probably not correct to use "works" for the
2019-11-02 13:43:24 <b_jonas> linux aio api at all)
2019-11-02 13:43:55 <b_jonas> hmm no, I remembered wrong, aio_write doesn't use preadv-style scatter-gather addressing
2019-11-02 13:44:10 <shachaf> I'm not talking about OS APIs, which support this already, but other APIs.
2019-11-02 13:44:10 <esowiki> 14[[07User:CMinusMinus14]]4 10 02https://esolangs.org/w/index.php?diff=66933&oldid=66903 5* 03CMinusMinus 5* (+27) 10
2019-11-02 13:44:12 <b_jonas> what api was it than otehr tahn preadv/pwritev, I wonder? I'm sure there was another
2019-11-02 13:44:24 <shachaf> Presumably that's also what fizzie is talking about also.
2019-11-02 13:44:38 <shachaf> Just some arbitrary function in your code like parse_thing() that takes a buffer and a length.
2019-11-02 13:44:43 <b_jonas> what other APIs then?
2019-11-02 13:44:47 <b_jonas> ah
2019-11-02 13:45:25 <b_jonas> shachaf: I think https://laurikari.net/tre/ allows you match a regex to a string that is not continuous, and even from a string that's read lazily
2019-11-02 13:45:56 <shachaf> OK, but regex matching is one special-case API which is already naturally written as a state machine anyway.
2019-11-02 13:46:18 <b_jonas> but of course continuous buffers have a lot of advantage
2019-11-02 13:46:20 <b_jonas> easier to optimize
2019-11-02 13:46:42 <b_jonas> I worked with bitmap images at my previous job, and I wouldn't like a non-continuous bitmap image
2019-11-02 13:49:01 <b_jonas> if I was given one, I'd just copy it into a proper continuous buffer (that is also aligned so that its rows are padded to a size that is 64 bytes long modulo 128 bytes; possibly padded a little at the beginning and end so I can read past the ends; and with the color channels either together and padded as if you had four channels if the input has three, or separately each one in a layer, depending on
2019-11-02 13:49:07 <b_jonas> what I want to do with the image)
2019-11-02 13:57:06 <shachaf> Of course APIs can do that, and keep their own buffers.
2019-11-02 13:57:29 <shachaf> But then you have a bunch of different buffers all the over the system, which doesn't seem that nice.
2019-11-02 14:10:23 <b_jonas> shachaf: no, in my experience once you have a continuous buffers, I could use them with multiple apis in place for image processing
2019-11-02 14:10:50 <b_jonas> there are subtleties about pixel formats, but in practice most of the time I didn't have to do unnecessary copies
2019-11-02 14:11:49 <shachaf> OK, but maybe you have one buffer for parsing an HTTP request, and then another buffer for parsing the image it contains, or whatever.
2019-11-02 14:12:11 <shachaf> Presumably you want to avoid a bunch of copies if you can.
2019-11-02 14:12:25 <b_jonas> shachaf: the HTTP buffer has compressed images
2019-11-02 14:12:40 <shachaf> Sure, another buffer for decompression.
2019-11-02 14:12:46 <b_jonas> I have to decode those to raw uncompressed anyway if I want to work with
2019-11-02 14:12:58 <shachaf> I'm describing the kind of thing you might want to avoid.
2019-11-02 14:13:06 <shachaf> Can your decompression algorithm operate directly on the circular buffer?
2019-11-02 14:13:07 <b_jonas> but in practice when I get an image from HTTP, I save it for multiple uses rather than process directly
2019-11-02 14:14:11 <b_jonas> shachaf: hmm, I don't know the details, I usually decompressed images with either ImageMagick or ffmpeg, and read them from a regular file
2019-11-02 14:16:01 <b_jonas> shachaf: for decoding video, I did store the uncompressed frames sparsely, so each frame can be anywhere in memory and they can be reused as a circular buffer
2019-11-02 14:20:00 <b_jonas> shachaf: when the video is read from network directly, rather than local file, then ffmpeg does the reading, so I don't know what kind of buffer it uses
2019-11-02 14:20:50 <b_jonas> admittedly I used ffmpeg as a separate process, so there are two copies of the uncompressed raw data there
2019-11-02 14:20:58 <b_jonas> so I guess I was wrong above
2019-11-02 14:21:09 <b_jonas> three copies if I want a planewise format
2019-11-02 14:45:18 <shachaf> Running a separate process for video decoding is obviously not reasonable for any kind of special-purpose application.

2019-11-02 20:44:40 <b_jonas> int-e: obviously the regex would be shorter in perl regex syntax, where you can use the "recursion" feature, not to build recursive regex, but to reuse longer regex multiple times

2019-11-02 20:56:48 <int-e> So... let me try... 5 states (remainders 0..4 only): 689; 6 states: 2701; 7 states: 10793
2019-11-02 20:57:31 <int-e> That really looks a bit worse than O(3^n). But of course the number of states is still small.
2019-11-02 20:57:44 <int-e> But wait. O(4^n) actually makes more sense.
2019-11-02 20:57:57 <int-e> And it looks pretty close to that.

2019-11-02 21:04:49 <int-e> But eh. My (fairly primitive) code is here: http://paste.debian.net/1113236/ ... it's optimizing, including a small peephole optimization (intelligently choosing between [07] and 0|7 depending on context), but fundamentally the question is whether there is a better way to convert a DFA (which happens to be a minimal NFA for the purpose) to a regexp than removing states one by one.
2019-11-02 21:06:19 <int-e> And I just don't know the answer to that question.
2019-11-02 21:06:38 <olsner> I tried a bit with https://github.com/qntm/greenery, it seems to always produce a regexp that converts back to the same DFA (which I suspect is not optimal for making a short regexp)
2019-11-02 21:07:43 <int-e> Well this is inherently a DFA... you have 7 remainders to keep track of, so that's a minimum of 7 states, and if you use 7 states then you'll be dealing with a DFA.

2019-11-02 21:28:57 <int-e> I mean, cosh(x) - 1 suffers from terrible cancellation around 0, but 0.5 * (expm1(x) + expm1(-x)) still suffers from cancellation (expm1(x) = x + x^2/2 + O(x^3), expm1(-x) = -x + x^2/2 + O(x^3), cosm1(x) = x^2/2 + O(x^3)...)

2019-11-02 21:34:08 <b_jonas> MIX uses a different floating point format that shifts by mix bytes, rather than bits, but the main text considers other bases too, including base 2
2019-11-02 21:35:44 <b_jonas> what the current edition doesn't consider is features specific to IEEE 754, which are infinities and NaNs
2019-11-02 21:36:23 <fizzie> b_jonas: I'm not sure what's up with it, my monitoring has been saying every now and then that it's down for a bit.
2019-11-02 21:36:27 <fizzie> Working for me now.
2019-11-02 21:36:35 <arseniiv> b_jonas: mix bytes => wait, there are its own bytes? How many bits?
2019-11-02 21:36:49 <b_jonas> arseniiv: either six bits, or two decimal digits
2019-11-02 21:37:28 <b_jonas> arseniiv: technically the book says the byte has a range from 0 to a maximum that is between 63 and 99 inclusive, so a binary MIX goes up to 63, a decimal up to 99, a ternary up to 81
2019-11-02 21:37:42 <b_jonas> arseniiv: see our wiki article
2019-11-02 21:37:51 <b_jonas> (and the book itself)
2019-11-02 21:38:30 <arseniiv> I wonder if MIX-related issues don’t make the text obscurer
2019-11-02 21:39:17 <arseniiv> yeah, I was to look for searching if I have it somewhere

2019-11-02 21:51:21 <b_jonas> there's Stoyan Gisbert's numerical analysis textbook, which is freely available online, but I think only exists in Hungarian. I don't know if there's any translation

2019-11-02 21:52:01 <olsner> b_jonas: finally a good excuse to learn hungarian?
2019-11-02 21:52:02 <b_jonas> it has three volumes, the first one is an introduction one that goes pretty far, and then the second and third are about solving partial differential equations numerically
2019-11-02 21:52:21 <b_jonas> therea are certainly more good books, I'm just not familiar with them
2019-11-02 21:52:57 <b_jonas> for the logs, IIRC Stoyan Gisbert's book is available somewhere from http://www.tankonyvtar.hu/hu/bongeszes , but that server is down right now
2019-11-02 21:53:31 <b_jonas> it says that it's down until 2019-11-03 though, so unless you see the date autoincrement, it'll hopefully come up later
2019-11-02 21:53:39 <arseniiv> <b_jonas> and then the second and third are about solving partial differential equations numerically => (aaaah!! you know, this is the night here, how would I go to sleep now)
