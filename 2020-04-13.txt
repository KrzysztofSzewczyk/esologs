2020-04-13 00:48:13 <zzo38> One idea I thought of for Magic: the Gathering, is there is meld to make a single object from two objects, which are then two objects again when it leaves the battlefield, so I thought the other way would be something that causes the card to become two objects once it enters the battlefield, and then moving either or both of them causes it to become a single object again.
2020-04-13 00:51:34 <zzo38> That is even more confusing, I think, but perhaps rules can be written which can work.
2020-04-13 00:55:04 <zzo38> I thought, each half can have different characteristics, timestamps, controller, counters, status, damage, etc, but never different owners or zone.

2020-04-13 01:09:39 <zzo38> The problem is in case two effects conflict in which zone they are trying to move the two halfs to.
2020-04-13 01:15:07 <zzo38> But, I think there are solutions to this too. One is the case of replacement effects, in which case the normal rules for replacement effects apply. The other case is if an effect tries to move one half to one zone and the other have to another zone, then it moves to the first zone, and the other half is no longer in the battlefield so the effect fails to find it and fails to move it.

2020-04-13 02:00:59 <Sgeo> What file formats allow for one file that can be read in multiple formats?
2020-04-13 02:14:10 <zzo38> Can you explain better what you mean, perhaps?
2020-04-13 02:19:27 <ais523> Sgeo__: you mean like a polyglot?
2020-04-13 02:19:53 <ais523> the main restriction is that the two formats can't require conflicting bytes at the same byte position (e.g. magic numbers that clash)
2020-04-13 02:20:01 <Sgeo> Yes, like a file format polygot, png and something else for instance. I copuld have sworn I saw one in a book about web securit
2020-04-13 02:20:02 <Sgeo> y
2020-04-13 02:20:22 <ais523> normally, if there isn't something that obviously blocks it like that, you can make it work
2020-04-13 02:20:38 <ais523> I vaguely remember that zip has its header at the end, so zip/something polyglots are common
2020-04-13 02:21:30 <ais523> yep
2020-04-13 02:21:38 <shachaf> Windows PE files don't have their header at the beginning, if I remember correctly?
2020-04-13 02:21:41 <ais523> oh wow this format is stupid
2020-04-13 02:22:06 <ais523> the zip file header comes at the end of the file, but its last field is free text (length-prefixed), it's variable length, and the header is at the start
2020-04-13 02:22:19 <ais523> this implies among other things that it's possible to polyglot zip with itself without violating the format
2020-04-13 02:22:22 <ais523> s oyou get an ambiguous zip file
2020-04-13 02:23:14 <ais523> shachaf: there are two headers, one is the "MZ" magic number that has to go at the start but just indicates a DOS/Windows executable in general, there's a second header at a fixed offset that clarifies what sort of executable
2020-04-13 02:23:32 <zzo38> You could have PNG and ZIP together; I have done that.
2020-04-13 02:23:47 <shachaf> Hmm, maybe the MZ is still required, which would make sense.
2020-04-13 02:24:04 <shachaf> But I vaguely remember something about a PE polyglot of some sort.
2020-04-13 02:24:18 <ais523> "MZ" is probably short enough to work into a polyglot with something else
2020-04-13 02:24:24 <ais523> source code, for example
2020-04-13 02:24:54 <ais523> oh wow, could you create source code that compiles into itself?
2020-04-13 02:24:57 <ais523> a sort of compile-time quine
2020-04-13 02:25:19 <shachaf> Treating the compiler as an interpreter.
2020-04-13 02:26:05 <esowiki> 14[[07Rand.Next()14]]4 M10 02https://esolangs.org/w/index.php?diff=70972&oldid=31579 5* 03LegionMammal978 5* (+14) 10fixed title
2020-04-13 02:26:18 <shachaf> I suspect it wouldn't be possible with typical architectures and languages.
2020-04-13 02:26:18 <ais523> well, you could go further and make the resulting executable print itself when actually run, too
2020-04-13 02:26:46 <ais523> the problem is that languages have a fixed executable stub, normally, which clearly isn't valid source code
2020-04-13 02:26:58 <ais523> at least if we're talking about Windows .exe
2020-04-13 02:27:11 <shachaf> You could generate .com
2020-04-13 02:27:11 <ais523> and I'm not sure what sort of linker magic you'd need to replace it
2020-04-13 02:27:17 <ais523> .com would be a lot easier, yes
2020-04-13 02:27:21 <zzo38> COM format DOS programs do not have MZ at the beginning; it is x86 instructions.
2020-04-13 02:27:45 <shachaf> But even that doesn't sound very feasible with most languages.
2020-04-13 02:28:11 <ais523> you just need to start a comment in one or the other language as soon as possible
2020-04-13 02:29:02 <shachaf> Hmm.
2020-04-13 02:29:30 <ais523> bleh, '/' isn't a valid machine code instruction on x86
2020-04-13 02:29:36 <ais523> err, on x86_64
2020-04-13 02:29:42 <ais523> .com is 32-bit, though, it might be valid there
