2020-04-13 00:48:13 <zzo38> One idea I thought of for Magic: the Gathering, is there is meld to make a single object from two objects, which are then two objects again when it leaves the battlefield, so I thought the other way would be something that causes the card to become two objects once it enters the battlefield, and then moving either or both of them causes it to become a single object again.
2020-04-13 00:51:34 <zzo38> That is even more confusing, I think, but perhaps rules can be written which can work.
2020-04-13 00:55:04 <zzo38> I thought, each half can have different characteristics, timestamps, controller, counters, status, damage, etc, but never different owners or zone.

2020-04-13 01:09:39 <zzo38> The problem is in case two effects conflict in which zone they are trying to move the two halfs to.
2020-04-13 01:15:07 <zzo38> But, I think there are solutions to this too. One is the case of replacement effects, in which case the normal rules for replacement effects apply. The other case is if an effect tries to move one half to one zone and the other have to another zone, then it moves to the first zone, and the other half is no longer in the battlefield so the effect fails to find it and fails to move it.

2020-04-13 02:00:59 <Sgeo> What file formats allow for one file that can be read in multiple formats?
2020-04-13 02:14:10 <zzo38> Can you explain better what you mean, perhaps?
2020-04-13 02:19:27 <ais523> Sgeo__: you mean like a polyglot?
2020-04-13 02:19:53 <ais523> the main restriction is that the two formats can't require conflicting bytes at the same byte position (e.g. magic numbers that clash)
2020-04-13 02:20:01 <Sgeo> Yes, like a file format polygot, png and something else for instance. I copuld have sworn I saw one in a book about web securit
2020-04-13 02:20:02 <Sgeo> y
2020-04-13 02:20:22 <ais523> normally, if there isn't something that obviously blocks it like that, you can make it work
2020-04-13 02:20:38 <ais523> I vaguely remember that zip has its header at the end, so zip/something polyglots are common
2020-04-13 02:21:30 <ais523> yep
2020-04-13 02:21:38 <shachaf> Windows PE files don't have their header at the beginning, if I remember correctly?
2020-04-13 02:21:41 <ais523> oh wow this format is stupid
2020-04-13 02:22:06 <ais523> the zip file header comes at the end of the file, but its last field is free text (length-prefixed), it's variable length, and the header is at the start
2020-04-13 02:22:19 <ais523> this implies among other things that it's possible to polyglot zip with itself without violating the format
2020-04-13 02:22:22 <ais523> s oyou get an ambiguous zip file
2020-04-13 02:23:14 <ais523> shachaf: there are two headers, one is the "MZ" magic number that has to go at the start but just indicates a DOS/Windows executable in general, there's a second header at a fixed offset that clarifies what sort of executable
2020-04-13 02:23:32 <zzo38> You could have PNG and ZIP together; I have done that.
2020-04-13 02:23:47 <shachaf> Hmm, maybe the MZ is still required, which would make sense.
2020-04-13 02:24:04 <shachaf> But I vaguely remember something about a PE polyglot of some sort.
2020-04-13 02:24:18 <ais523> "MZ" is probably short enough to work into a polyglot with something else
2020-04-13 02:24:24 <ais523> source code, for example
2020-04-13 02:24:54 <ais523> oh wow, could you create source code that compiles into itself?
2020-04-13 02:24:57 <ais523> a sort of compile-time quine
2020-04-13 02:25:19 <shachaf> Treating the compiler as an interpreter.

2020-04-13 02:26:18 <shachaf> I suspect it wouldn't be possible with typical architectures and languages.
2020-04-13 02:26:18 <ais523> well, you could go further and make the resulting executable print itself when actually run, too
2020-04-13 02:26:46 <ais523> the problem is that languages have a fixed executable stub, normally, which clearly isn't valid source code
2020-04-13 02:26:58 <ais523> at least if we're talking about Windows .exe
2020-04-13 02:27:11 <shachaf> You could generate .com
2020-04-13 02:27:11 <ais523> and I'm not sure what sort of linker magic you'd need to replace it
2020-04-13 02:27:17 <ais523> .com would be a lot easier, yes
2020-04-13 02:27:21 <zzo38> COM format DOS programs do not have MZ at the beginning; it is x86 instructions.
2020-04-13 02:27:45 <shachaf> But even that doesn't sound very feasible with most languages.
2020-04-13 02:28:11 <ais523> you just need to start a comment in one or the other language as soon as possible
2020-04-13 02:29:02 <shachaf> Hmm.
2020-04-13 02:29:30 <ais523> bleh, '/' isn't a valid machine code instruction on x86
2020-04-13 02:29:36 <ais523> err, on x86_64
2020-04-13 02:29:42 <ais523> .com is 32-bit, though, it might be valid there
2020-04-13 02:30:20 <ais523> ooh, it is
2020-04-13 02:30:22 <ais523> also, I'm wrong
2020-04-13 02:30:24 <ais523> .com is 16-bit
2020-04-13 02:30:50 <shachaf> Hmm, https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/das
2020-04-13 02:30:53 <ais523> but "/*" corresponds to DAS followed by the first byte of a SUB instruction
2020-04-13 02:30:55 <ais523> we can live with that
2020-04-13 02:32:07 <ais523> actually we can't, short of inline asm
2020-04-13 02:32:14 <ais523> but I guess inline asm is acceptable in a challenge like this
2020-04-13 02:32:27 <ais523> or defining main as raw machine code, I guess
2020-04-13 02:32:37 <shachaf> I thought your input would be assembly in the first place.
2020-04-13 02:32:43 <ais523> oh, I was thinking C
2020-04-13 02:32:50 <ais523> if very system-specific C
2020-04-13 02:33:35 <shachaf> ; is CMP
2020-04-13 02:35:02 <ais523> aww, I have a 16-bit compiler on this system but it seems to be missing the appropriate libraries to compile to DOS .com
2020-04-13 02:35:22 <ais523> I guess the next question is "why do I have a 16-bit C compiler on this system" but I assume there was a reason at the time
2020-04-13 02:36:01 <ais523> it takes K&R C as input; again I'm not entirely sure why
2020-04-13 02:36:08 <ais523> but in my test program I had to correct "int main(void)" to "int main()"
2020-04-13 02:36:27 <shachaf> `asm cmp eax, [rax]
2020-04-13 02:36:28 <HackEso> 0:  3b 00   cmp eax,DWORD PTR [rax]

2020-04-13 02:37:04 <ais523> shachaf: you want most of the machine code program to be inside a string literal or comment from the point of view of the asm, and most of the asm to be goto'd over from the machine code program
2020-04-13 02:37:17 <shachaf> Yes.
2020-04-13 02:37:30 <shachaf> I was thinking of ; comments in an assembler.
2020-04-13 02:37:52 <shachaf> It's easy enough if your language allows unprintable characters in comments, which I was thinking it wouldn't for some reason.
2020-04-13 02:39:55 <ais523> that depends on the lexer more than anything else
2020-04-13 02:40:07 <ais523> many languages even allow unprintables in string literals

2020-04-13 03:22:03 <Sgeo> It didn't work
2020-04-13 03:22:56 <Sgeo> zzo38, you're saying this should result in a valid zip? cat WorldsPlayer-956.world WorldsPlayer-956.zip > WorldsPlayer-9567.zip
2020-04-13 03:24:07 <zzo38> Yes, although it is possible that some programs might not recognize it. It also might not work if the code that identifies the beginning of a ZIP file is found somewhere inside the WorldsPlayer file (it is "PK\x03\x04")
2020-04-13 03:26:10 <Sgeo> That's not the case here, so why isn't it opening
2020-04-13 03:26:49 <Sgeo> Oh maybe because what you said
2020-04-13 03:27:28 <zzo38> Another possibility might be that the index at the end of the file requires absolute offsets, although I don't know whether or not that is the case.
2020-04-13 03:28:16 <zzo38> But I don't think so; I seem to remember I have once concatenated a PNG and ZIP together and was able to open it with either a PNG or ZIP program just fine.
2020-04-13 03:31:23 <ais523> <Sgeo__> Not sure I understand the .zip header thing. Can I have another format's magic at the end still? ← yes, the last field of the .zip header (which goes at the end of the file) is "comment", which gives you room to stick another magic number in there
2020-04-13 03:31:58 <ais523> also, the .zip file header references other parts of the file relative to the /start/ of the file, so a pure concatenation won't work
2020-04-13 03:32:10 <Sgeo> ...how did unzip work?
2020-04-13 03:32:18 <ais523> you can append to a .zip file without rewriting the first part of the file, but that requires small changes to the second part
2020-04-13 03:32:34 <zzo38> Maybe I misremembered; I don't know
2020-04-13 03:32:39 <ais523> Sgeo__: as far as I can tell from the specification, the format is ambiguous; you can write one file that's valid as a zip file in two different ways
2020-04-13 03:32:45 <ais523> so presumably unzip has to pick one arbitrarily

2020-04-13 03:33:23 <zzo38> O, maybe different implementations work differently. That is also who I was unable to unzip a PDF/ZIP combination file with one program but another program worked, I suppose.

2020-04-13 05:34:39 <zzo38> I don't have knowledge about angels, and I doubt many people here do, nor do I understand what you are talking about.
2020-04-13 05:35:10 <zzo38> (You could try EFnet or DALnet, like the message from HackEso says, I suppose. Maybe they know, and if they don't know either, then I don't know who to ask; sorry.)
2020-04-13 05:36:32 <zzo38> Is anyone think something about my idea I mentioned about the Magic: the Gathering? I thought to call it "fission", so, it is a fission card.

2020-04-13 14:32:26 <tromp> int-e: i don't understand the step from line 108 to 109 in latest BB.txt
2020-04-13 14:32:57 <tromp> (i pushed some commits)
2020-04-13 14:52:27 <esowiki> 14[[07Slistp14]]4 M10 02https://esolangs.org/w/index.php?diff=70988&oldid=20914 5* 03LegionMammal978 5* (+14) 10fixed title
2020-04-13 14:54:49 <b_jonas> Sgeo__: this yes, some files can contain fixed strings that help users identify the type of file, but aren't actually read by the reader, so they're optional.
2020-04-13 14:55:33 <b_jonas> eg. many of my perl or python scripts start with a shebang line that is not really used for anything but helpful as a programmer
2020-04-13 14:55:45 <b_jonas> #!perl or #!python3
2020-04-13 15:01:26 <myname> aren't shebangs supposed to be absolute paths?
2020-04-13 15:01:49 <myname> which is why you are seeing /bin/env python or the like
2020-04-13 15:02:01 <b_jonas> myname: if you want to execute the script directly then yes
2020-04-13 15:02:08 <b_jonas> but I don't do that, I execute them with perl or python3
2020-04-13 15:02:21 <b_jonas> perl still reads command-line options from there
2020-04-13 15:02:34 <b_jonas> and python has a py wrapper that reads the version number (python2 vs python3) and a bit more
2020-04-13 15:02:41 <b_jonas> but I don't really use those features
2020-04-13 15:02:51 <b_jonas> these are just mostly for convenience as a human
2020-04-13 15:03:10 <b_jonas> also the .pl extension is terribly ambiguous
2020-04-13 15:03:27 <b_jonas> at one point I wondered if we should just use .pm as the extension of all perl scripts

2020-04-13 15:06:43 <ais523> @pl \x y -> y x
2020-04-13 15:06:43 <lambdabot> flip id
2020-04-13 15:06:59 <ais523> together with Perl and Prolog that's at least three meanings of pl
2020-04-13 15:07:15 <b_jonas> that too, yes
2020-04-13 15:07:21 <ais523> also I think there are circumstances under which shebangs work without the /
2020-04-13 15:07:31 <ais523> but it probably depends a lot on the shell and OS
2020-04-13 15:07:50 <ais523> there are some UNIXes which treat the magic number for an executable as "#! /" (four bytes)
2020-04-13 15:07:58 <ais523> which is why I typically put a space in my shebangs
2020-04-13 15:08:07 <ais523> even though I think that's an obsolete way of doing it
2020-04-13 15:08:07 <b_jonas> I didn't know that
2020-04-13 15:08:14 <b_jonas> I never put a space
2020-04-13 15:08:43 <b_jonas> I just like shebang as a human-readable way to declare the type of a file, even to people not familiar with that file format
2020-04-13 15:09:06 <b_jonas> obviously there are many formats where it doesn't work because they have a magic number at the start
2020-04-13 15:09:26 <b_jonas> but file formats could be designed such that the magic number isn't at the start, so you can put a short comment at the start
2020-04-13 15:10:19 <b_jonas> especially esoteric file formats
2020-04-13 15:10:19 <ais523> <Wikpedia> It has been claimed that some old versions of Unix expect the normal shebang to be followed by a space and a slash (#! /), but this appears to be untrue;[citation needed]
2020-04-13 15:10:20 <ais523> OK, that makes things even more interesting
2020-04-13 15:10:21 <ais523> especially the {{cn}}

2020-04-13 15:12:46 <ais523> in a work-in-progress version of Underlambda I put a shebang /in/ the magic number

2020-04-13 15:12:55 <b_jonas> ais523: does linux even allow a space between the shebang and the interpreter filename, for the purpose of plain execve?
2020-04-13 15:13:27 <b_jonas> oh also, it can be worth to design a file format such that it at least ignores a shebang line
2020-04-13 15:13:56 <b_jonas> modern shell scripts already have that property, as well as perl and python scripts

2020-04-13 15:14:33 <ais523> one of the larger reasons for # comments is so that they're shebang-compatible

2020-04-13 15:14:44 <ais523> and there are some languages that don't have # comments, but ignore the first line if it starts with #!
2020-04-13 15:15:03 <b_jonas> ais523: no, I think that's backwards, the shebang magic bytes were chosen because they're compatible with shell script comments
2020-04-13 15:16:00 <ais523> b_jonas: can't both be true?
2020-04-13 15:16:16 <tromp> kritixilithos: see https://mathoverflow.net/questions/353514/whats-the-smallest-lambda-calculus-term-not-known-to-have-a-normal-form
2020-04-13 15:16:20 <ais523> new language uses # comments, to be compatible with other tooling that assumes # comments
2020-04-13 15:18:15 <b_jonas> ais523: probably, for some new languages
2020-04-13 15:18:47 <b_jonas> also it's a pity that C preprocessors don't ignore the #! line, not even if you use a double slash at the start of the path
2020-04-13 15:19:13 <b_jonas> so there's probably no way to start a C source file with a shebang

2020-04-13 16:02:25 <oren> tcc supports shebang lines so you can have executable C "scripts"
2020-04-13 16:02:27 <b_jonas> also, you invoke cc ? I always invoke gcc or g++ directly, rather than cc and c++

2020-04-13 16:03:58 <ais523> b_jonas: based on experience with the megapolyglot, we believe the most portable way to start a program is with a "pre-preprocessed #line directive"
2020-04-13 16:04:06 <ais523> which looks like # then a number then a string
2020-04-13 16:04:16 <b_jonas> ais523: for a pre-processed file, sure
2020-04-13 16:04:22 <b_jonas> pre-processed C file
2020-04-13 16:04:28 <b_jonas> but then you can't use the preprocessor
2020-04-13 16:04:35 <ais523> b_jonas: most C compilers are happy to accept pre-preprocessed input and will preprocess it a second time
2020-04-13 16:04:42 <b_jonas> that doesn't hurt the polyglot much, but in real world C source files I want to use preprocessor directives
2020-04-13 16:04:56 <b_jonas> wait really? they just accept a line directive?
2020-04-13 16:04:57 <b_jonas> nice
2020-04-13 16:05:01 <ais523> as are, oddly, many implementations for languages other than C, even if they don't normally use the C preprocessor
2020-04-13 16:05:03 <b_jonas> I mean an output line directive
2020-04-13 16:05:36 <ais523> yep, just tested
2020-04-13 16:05:57 <b_jonas> ok
2020-04-13 16:05:59 <ais523> # 1 "hello.c" \ int main(void) { \   puts("Hello, world!"); \ }
2020-04-13 16:06:13 <ais523> compiled under gcc I get a warning for "hello.c" even though the file is named something else, about the implicit definition of puts
2020-04-13 16:06:20 <ais523> and the resulting executable works fine
2020-04-13 16:06:24 <b_jonas> um, that doesn't actually have a preprocessor directive like #include <stdio.h> after the line directive
2020-04-13 16:06:50 <ais523> OK, I added a preprocessor directive, and it was honoured
2020-04-13 16:06:55 <b_jonas> good
2020-04-13 16:07:08 <ais523> which is not surprising, how would it know to turn the preprocessor off when it encountered the compiled-#line?
2020-04-13 16:07:34 <b_jonas> yeah. I just expected that the output preprocessor line would give an error in the preprocessor
2020-04-13 16:07:45 <ais523> it works in clang too: https://tio.run/#c-clang

2020-04-13 16:10:52 <ais523> which causes a huge number of languages to temporarily suspend the parser
2020-04-13 16:10:55 <b_jonas> https://rextester.com can compile with MSVC :-)
2020-04-13 16:11:17 <ais523> (the filename was chosen to put lots of esolangs into a comment / string literal / large jump, too)
2020-04-13 16:12:04 <ais523> source_file.c(1): error C2019: expected preprocessor directive, found '1'
2020-04-13 16:12:06 <ais523> aww
2020-04-13 16:12:29 <b_jonas> I don't know what version of MSVC it runs though
2020-04-13 16:12:32 <ais523> I guess it wouldn't be the first time MSVC didn't follow a de-facto standard that nonetheless wasn't an actual standard
2020-04-13 16:12:39 <ais523> Microsoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.00.23506 for x64
2020-04-13 16:12:55 <b_jonas> that's recent
2020-04-13 16:12:55 <b_jonas> nice
2020-04-13 16:15:47 <oren> yeah when I compile things I use cc typically, i think because one of my first computers had gcc installed as "cc" and didn't accept a "gcc" command
2020-04-13 16:16:00 <b_jonas> I see
2020-04-13 16:16:43 <oren> what's really weird is now you see people with clang installed as "gcc"
2020-04-13 16:17:15 <b_jonas> that's not too weird, clang is pretty closely compatible to gcc
2020-04-13 16:18:27 <oren> but what that means is, "gcc" has become so intrenched as "the command to compile stuff"
2020-04-13 16:18:57 <oren> cc has been forgoten, even though it's one less letter to type
2020-04-13 16:19:12 <b_jonas> yes, because before linux and gcc got so spread, there were computers with separate cc and gcc commands. that's why autoconf scripts try gcc first, before cc
2020-04-13 16:19:41 <b_jonas> also now there's c99 as a command name too
2020-04-13 16:19:57 <b_jonas> because of POSIX or something like that
2020-04-13 16:20:47 <ais523> oren: my first UNIXish environment had cc as provided by the OS manufacturer, it wasn't gcc
2020-04-13 16:21:18 <ais523> it also had c99 but I didn't discover that for ages, and it was presented as though it were an entirely separate program from cc (although of course they probably shared a lot of code)
2020-04-13 16:21:43 <ais523> so I still think of cc as being "the OS stock C compiler" and gcc as being a specific C compiler
2020-04-13 16:21:54 <ais523> and on Linux, assume that the two are the same, as gcc is the standard C compiler on Linux
2020-04-13 16:22:00 <ais523> (but this doesn't hold on other Unices)
2020-04-13 16:22:29 <b_jonas> just as glibc is also the standard on linuxes, but it might be one of the other brands of libc that imitate glibc
2020-04-13 16:22:54 <ais523> "gcc" on Mac OS X is normally actually clang, isn't it, nowadays?
2020-04-13 16:23:18 <ais523> now I'm interested in what "cc" typically is on BSD
2020-04-13 16:23:36 <b_jonas> may depend on which BSD
2020-04-13 16:23:55 <ais523> I was wondering about that
2020-04-13 16:24:35 <ais523> I'm surprised that BSD doesn't get more attention, actually; it's a perfectly solid OS and for most programs, it's very comparable to Linux, with easy porting both ways
2020-04-13 16:25:32 <myname> hardware compatibility, probably
2020-04-13 16:26:08 <ais523> that sort-of makes sense, I assume it has a smaller community of driver-writers
2020-04-13 16:26:24 <ais523> I'd expect the hardware compatibility to be at least decent on older machines, though
2020-04-13 16:28:24 <b_jonas> I suspect that BSD doesn't get much attention because it's non-proselytizing, or however that word is called, that is, there is a small community of people who use BSD, but they aren't actively trying to convince other people to also use BSD, whereas Linux fanatics try to convince people to use Linux all the time
2020-04-13 16:29:01 <ais523> well, when programmers proselytize, they often do so by writing code to make things more user-friendly

2020-04-13 16:29:42 <b_jonas> that's the good kind, yes
2020-04-13 16:31:33 <b_jonas> plus I think it's also that at least some BSD activity focuses on using BSD in servers and routers and the like
2020-04-13 16:31:58 <b_jonas> rather than workstations or mobile phones
2020-04-13 16:32:20 <ais523> huh, assuming you aren't on Windows: http://localhost:631
2020-04-13 16:32:32 <ais523> I kind-of hope that thing's firewalled by default
2020-04-13 16:33:07 <b_jonas> just look at https://www.pcbsd.org , they used to brand themselves as a FreeBSD variant useful as a desktop environment for ordinary home users, but the distribution has disappeared or got renamed, and they now target servers
2020-04-13 16:33:20 <ais523> I guess that's one way to make a semi-major part of an operating system OS-independent but it still seems really weird
2020-04-13 16:33:22 <b_jonas> ais523: is that the printer server?
2020-04-13 16:33:49 <b_jonas> I don't have anything running on that port here
2020-04-13 16:34:12 <ais523> b_jonas: yes
2020-04-13 16:34:20 <ais523> it even has Apple branding
2020-04-13 16:34:25 <ais523> despite me being on Linux
2020-04-13 16:35:03 <ais523> it seems to contain a list of everything I've ever printed, too
2020-04-13 16:35:15 <ais523> (although I hardly ever print things so it's quite short)
2020-04-13 16:49:24 <ais523> hmm, I wonder what the greatest proportion of the set of all bytestrings is, such that after all common sorts of encoding-related damage, the original string can be uniquely reconstructed
2020-04-13 16:49:58 <ais523> obviously sticking to printable ASCII survives all common forms of encoding-related damage, but I think you safely can expand this into some of the control codes and high-bit-set characters
2020-04-13 16:50:19 <ais523> (but not all of them, because you need to be able to, e.g., distinguish an unchanged source from mojibake)
2020-04-13 16:51:27 <esowiki> 14[[07Stacked Brainfuck14]]4 10 02https://esolangs.org/w/index.php?diff=70990&oldid=39483 5* 03LegionMammal978 5* (+36) 10/* Implementation */ fixed link
2020-04-13 16:52:11 <b_jonas> that may depend on what you count as encoding-related. does word-wrapping count? HTML turning whitespace sequences to single spaces?
2020-04-13 16:52:33 <b_jonas> old forums that output HTML from wiki-like input that change some spaces to nbsp?
2020-04-13 16:54:47 <ais523> I think all those examples count
2020-04-13 16:54:55 <ais523> so sticking to printable ASCII is not in fact enough
2020-04-13 16:55:05 <ais523> (another encoding-related issue that can happen in printable ASCII: & becoming &amp;)
2020-04-13 16:55:50 <b_jonas> oh yes, that too
2020-04-13 16:56:18 <ais523> there's also the case of stray = signs from quoted-printable
2020-04-13 16:56:29 <ais523> which can affect even input that's entirely alphanumeric
2020-04-13 16:56:40 <b_jonas> would it count when web thingies replace anything with an @ sign in it with some javascript email address protection thing? when twitter or twitch chat replaces anything with a dot in it with a http hyperlink?
2020-04-13 16:56:44 <ais523> and ASCII/EBCDIC misinterpretation, I guess, although that isn't common nowadays
2020-04-13 16:57:14 <ais523> b_jonas: the former of those is done by Cloudflare under some circumstances, isn't it?
2020-04-13 16:57:18 <ais523> which makes it very common
2020-04-13 16:57:24 <ais523> and the latter is also frequently seen
2020-04-13 16:57:36 <b_jonas> I've first seen it on the FSF's mailing list archive web interface
2020-04-13 16:57:48 <ais523> (another related issue: ASCII sequences that look like emoticons being replaced with Unicode or even <img>-tag-based smileys)
2020-04-13 16:58:07 <ais523> b_jonas: oh right, mailing list archives do that too
2020-04-13 16:58:09 <b_jonas> oh yeah, Mibbit
2020-04-13 16:58:27 <b_jonas> as well as some phpbb, and in fact twitch chat too now that I think of it
2020-04-13 16:58:51 <b_jonas> changing the :D to a smiley in Data::Dumper, turning :) and :-) to the same thing
2020-04-13 17:00:12 <ais523> ASCII-as-UTF-16 misinterpretation has to be pretty rare
2020-04-13 17:00:17 <b_jonas> there's also some wordpress-based web comment forms that turn ascii double quotes to fancy quotes
2020-04-13 17:00:30 <ais523> although didn't Notepad do that once?
2020-04-13 17:00:50 <ais523> ah yes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_hid_the_facts
2020-04-13 17:01:01 <b_jonas> I think that usually happens backwards, reading an utf-16 file as if it was some ascii-compatible encoding and adding nul bytes between
2020-04-13 17:02:04 <ais523> b_jonas: yes but in that case it's normally really obvious what happened
2020-04-13 17:02:27 <ais523> if you see a file that looks like ASCII but there's a NUL byte every other byte, you can typically figure out what went wrong even if you've never heard of UTF-16
2020-04-13 17:02:40 <ais523> (and some formats, like VT-100, ignore NUL, so the file will even appear to work)
2020-04-13 17:02:40 <b_jonas> ah, I didn't know about that one
2020-04-13 17:02:49 <ais523> (assuming it has no non-ASCII characters)
2020-04-13 17:03:18 <b_jonas> usually yes. not if I just try to run a grep command, get no matches, and forget that the file is utf-16 encoded
2020-04-13 17:03:37 <b_jonas> that happened to me a few times recently

2020-04-13 17:06:58 <ais523> I'm reading blog posts about the Notepad misdetection
2020-04-13 17:07:20 <ais523> and one of them mentions that the CRLF character is explicitly illegal in Unicode, presumably to make detection easier
2020-04-13 17:07:22 <ais523> I think it's just lying though?

2020-04-13 17:07:36 <b_jonas> oh, there's also some encoding-related garbage that you can get from perl's encoding io layer, which is somehow messed up in more than one way
2020-04-13 17:07:42 <ais523> hmm, perhaps it only detects it that way round
2020-04-13 17:07:55 <ais523> but it'd be weird to have such a detection for one endianness but not the other
2020-04-13 17:08:22 <ais523> I guess this is one argument to prefer UTF16-LE over UTF16-BE
2020-04-13 17:08:30 <b_jonas> in particular, on windows with a native win32 perl, when I try to write a file with layer :encoding(utf-16-le):crlf , I get garbage. no, it doesn't just output the crlf wrong, it outputs everything wrong after some point in the file.
2020-04-13 17:08:42 <esowiki> 14[[07User:Hakerh40014]]4 10 02https://esolangs.org/w/index.php?diff=70991&oldid=70882 5* 03Hakerh400 5* (+134) 10/* Languages */
2020-04-13 17:08:47 <b_jonas> many years ago I saw the encoding layer cause to output some lines twice.
2020-04-13 17:08:56 <ais523> b_jonas: how does that compare to :crlf:encoding(utf-16-le)?
2020-04-13 17:09:13 <ais523> I'd expect at least one of those to replace all the 0x0D bytes in the Unicode encoding with 0x0D/0x0A pairs, which would throw off the byte pairing
2020-04-13 17:09:25 <b_jonas> ais523: I don't recall the details, I think it's just :encoding(utf-16-le) that's buggy, because :crlf is the default
2020-04-13 17:09:43 <b_jonas> a workaround is to use :raw:encoding(utf-16-le) and then put crlf at the end of my lines manually
2020-04-13 17:10:23 <b_jonas> ais523: no, it isn't just messed up in any of those trivial ways, and the output that I tried to write is mostly ascii
2020-04-13 17:10:40 <b_jonas> I didn't really try to isolate the bug, I just gave up
2020-04-13 17:10:43 <b_jonas> and worked it around
2020-04-13 17:10:54 <b_jonas> and also trying to move away for perl, not only for this reason
2020-04-13 17:11:05 <ais523> heh, the blog post later discuses the MALAYALAM LETTER UU issue
2020-04-13 17:11:20 <ais523> b_jonas: what are you planning to move onto?
2020-04-13 17:11:45 <b_jonas> ais523: python3. I already have a csv reader and writer in python, and a lot of more specific scripts related to work.
2020-04-13 17:12:13 <b_jonas> eventually I should make a patched python3 that adds extra syntax so I can write python in a single line, useful for command-line or IRC
2020-04-13 17:12:36 <b_jonas> it can be done in a sane backwards compatible way, I already have a candidate for the syntax
2020-04-13 17:12:47 <ais523> b_jonas: I'm considering looking for alternatives to Perl, however I dislike Python and don't consider it a reasonable alternative for me
2020-04-13 17:12:50 <b_jonas> ideally should get that thing into vanilla python, because I'm not the only one who's missing that feature
2020-04-13 17:13:02 <b_jonas> but I'm not getting my hope up
2020-04-13 17:13:33 <b_jonas> still, it's a pure syntax extension, so the modified python would be compatible with all existing python code, which is the whole point
2020-04-13 17:13:43 <b_jonas> ais523: any specific reason why you dislike python
2020-04-13 17:14:00 <b_jonas> one advantage of python is that the standard library is more suited to native windows
2020-04-13 17:14:30 <b_jonas> not perfectly suited, it's still written by unix programmers, but you don't have to install CPAN modules to open files with non-ascii filenames or any of that nonsense
2020-04-13 17:14:50 <ais523> b_jonas: I think the largest design flaw is to have a language where values carry types, with strong restrictions on how types can be combined + context-sensitive overloading, /but/ no static typing
2020-04-13 17:15:21 <ais523> although Perl started to move in that direction over time with operator overloading, at least most packages keep the normal meanings of the operators
2020-04-13 17:15:38 <ais523> + and * in Python can do two unrelated things based on where the arguments come from
2020-04-13 17:16:27 <b_jonas> ais523: if you want static typing, there's always rust and C++, and you can mix them with python just as you can with perl

2020-04-13 17:16:53 <ais523> so there's this big distinction between "2" and 2 in how they behave, and code will only be correct for one or the other
2020-04-13 17:17:11 <b_jonas> ais523: I don't find that too much of a problem, but ok, that's a good specific answer
2020-04-13 17:17:14 <ais523> but there's no sensible way to have this checked automatically
2020-04-13 17:17:29 <ais523> Perl doesn't have this problem because "2" and 2 act very similarly in any numeric context
2020-04-13 17:17:30 <b_jonas> I understand why you'd want different names for the concat and repeat operators
2020-04-13 17:17:36 <ais523> and, indeed, in any string context
2020-04-13 17:17:58 <ais523> you can distinguish them if you really want to, but normally you don't want to
2020-04-13 17:18:18 <ais523> also this has lead to bugs in practice
2020-04-13 17:18:27 <ais523> the Python program I most often use is the Jelly interpreter
2020-04-13 17:18:30 <b_jonas> right, but in python, "2" and 2 never act similarly, so this generally doesn't cause confusion
2020-04-13 17:18:38 <b_jonas> just like in C
2020-04-13 17:19:04 <b_jonas> about the only time when they act similarly is if you pass them to the int or float constructor
2020-04-13 17:19:08 <ais523> and it leads to programs like the following quine: https://tio.run/##y0rNyan8//9R4z4gerhjCRD9/w8A
2020-04-13 17:19:14 <ais523> which isn't even valid Jelly but the interpreter doesn't notice
2020-04-13 17:19:41 <ais523> b_jonas: the confusion is the lack of a type error when passing a value of the wrong type
2020-04-13 17:20:07 <ais523> other things I dislike are the way it does variable declarations, and the whitespace-sensitivity
2020-04-13 17:20:57 <ais523> also the package manager, but cpan the package managing software isn't all that great either (I'm fine with CPAN the repository, though, and with cpanm)
2020-04-13 17:21:27 <b_jonas> ais523: right, but it doesn't occur often. the + operator for add vs concatenation, the * operator for multiplication vs repeat, the str function semi-pretty-printing things, int and float converting numbers or parsing strings, plus the [] operator for arrays vs dictionaries, those are about the only cases when this happens
2020-04-13 17:21:38 <b_jonas> most of the time when I pass the wrong type of value, I get an error
2020-04-13 17:21:58 <ais523> the ⁾⁾ḤḤ quine exploits the second case
2020-04-13 17:22:12 <b_jonas> as for variable declarations and whitespace sensitivity, those complaints I do understand
2020-04-13 17:22:16 <ais523> ⁾ creates a 2-character string, and a string in Jelly is an array of characters
2020-04-13 17:22:17 <b_jonas> I want to fix the whitespace sensitivity
2020-04-13 17:22:31 <b_jonas> I probably don't want to fix variable declarations, though there could be an extension fixing that
2020-04-13 17:22:33 <ais523> so it creates the string ⁾Ḥ
2020-04-13 17:22:41 <ais523> then Ḥ doubles a number, or all numbers in an array
2020-04-13 17:22:42 <b_jonas> mind you, Julia's rules for variable declarations are way worse than python's IMO
2020-04-13 17:22:47 <ais523> and you can guess what happened next :-D
2020-04-13 17:23:10 <ais523> anyway, gtg

2020-04-13 17:25:05 <b_jonas> more likely in that crazy esolang idea that I'll probably never develop, the configurable one where you can choose between APL order and C order and even more for function calls, I'd have 2*2 options for how variable declarations and scoping work, as in 2 for explicit my and implicit nonlocal vs explicit nonlocal and implicit my, and if/while/for creating a scope vs if/while/for not creating a scope

2020-04-13 18:12:23 <tromp> int-e: induction on size of term in B^V' ?
2020-04-13 18:14:02 <int-e> tromp: I'm treating B^V = H[W^V X^V] = H[W^V (W^V u B^V)] as the inductive definition of B^V.
2020-04-13 18:14:14 <int-e> tromp: But yes, induction on the size will work as well.
2020-04-13 18:14:43 <int-e> tromp: it's proper because while H may be empty, we take at least one W^V off.
2020-04-13 18:14:47 <tromp> ok, i'll add an intermediate line =     H[W^V'[v := X^V] (W^V'[v := X^V] ∪ B^V'[v := X^V]) ]   to make the steps clearer
2020-04-13 18:15:50 <int-e> Funny that we both added an nf[_]size command.
2020-04-13 18:17:42 <tromp> i only did so after you mentioned it (but before checking the repo)
2020-04-13 19:10:06 <kspalaiologos> so essentially if I wanted to write a JIT or AOT compiler based on my current interpreter in JAva
2020-04-13 19:10:20 <kspalaiologos> should I target java bytecode, C, x86 assembly, llvm... ?

2020-04-13 19:13:02 <kspalaiologos> that's what I think
2020-04-13 19:13:08 <kspalaiologos> so I can't make a decision really
2020-04-13 19:13:16 <kspalaiologos> I think I may go with Java bytecode
2020-04-13 19:13:19 User Name: imode = imode!~linear@unaffiliated/imode
2020-04-13 19:13:19 <imode> where are you intending to run this.
2020-04-13 19:13:31 <imode> and is this like a brainfuck interpreter?
2020-04-13 19:13:31 <kspalaiologos> but then I'll have to clog my program with BCEL
2020-04-13 19:13:55 <kspalaiologos> imode, said that already, I want it as portable as possible; and this is a brainfuck interpreter now, but I can eaisly transform it into a compiler
2020-04-13 19:15:15 <zzo38> C code may be more portable, or a simple code using an emulation
2020-04-13 19:15:32 <imode> you haven't said it in my logs, so I don't think asking is out of the question.
2020-04-13 19:15:46 User Name: ais523 = ais523!~ais523@unaffiliated/ais523
2020-04-13 19:15:46 <ais523> kspalaiologos: if you're writing in Java, then Java bytecode may be a good target format, as the Java runtime will JIT that once you generate it
2020-04-13 19:15:47 <imode> if you want portability, yeah, you can hardly beat Java.
2020-04-13 19:15:55 <ais523> so you basically have a platform-independent JIT
2020-04-13 19:16:12 <imode> if you want _actual_ portability, compile it to C. every platform has a C compiler at some point.
2020-04-13 19:16:18 <kspalaiologos> well then
2020-04-13 19:16:24 <ais523> at work I use a library called ASM (confusingly) to generate Java bytecode at runtime
2020-04-13 19:16:32 <ais523> C is a good target language if you want AOT rather than JIT
2020-04-13 19:16:33 <kspalaiologos> I'll go with BCEL instaed
2020-04-13 19:16:42 <kspalaiologos> what about performance
2020-04-13 19:16:46 <kspalaiologos> and optimization
2020-04-13 19:17:08 <ais523> C compiler optimizers are pretty good nowadays, although I can normally beat them programming by hand
2020-04-13 19:17:23 <kspalaiologos> C may be orders of magnitude more performant than Java
2020-04-13 19:17:28 <ais523> although, the workings of modern computers are confusing, and optimizing for speed is really counterintuitive sometimes
2020-04-13 19:17:39 <kspalaiologos> depends on your knowledge on the platforms
2020-04-13 19:17:46 <kspalaiologos> cache lines, instruction alignment
2020-04-13 19:17:54 <kspalaiologos> it all becomes logical at certain point
2020-04-13 19:18:03 <ais523> out-of-order execution has a much larger impact than instruction alignment
2020-04-13 19:18:11 <kspalaiologos> yeah this too
2020-04-13 19:18:20 <ais523> and it interacts with caching in weird ways
2020-04-13 19:19:34 <kspalaiologos> yeah, I'm going with java
2020-04-13 19:19:41 <ais523> a while ago, to test out my optimization skills, I decided to aim for the following challenge: given a simple (inlinable) function that generates a continuous stream of bytes in a way that doesn't take up much of the CPU's time
2020-04-13 19:19:47 <ais523> write the resulting bytes to memory as quickly as possible
2020-04-13 19:19:53 <arseniiv> ha, C, Java. I plan to compile something into Python (as for programs written in it it’s pretty logical; there’s a module to work with its own AST and a function for compiling it)
2020-04-13 19:19:54 <zzo38> I thikn computers should be designed less confusing
2020-04-13 19:20:21 <ais523> it took a lot of attempts and experimentation to find an optimal (or as optimal as I could get it) solution, but I beat the C compilers fairly quickly
2020-04-13 19:20:22 <kspalaiologos> python doesn't seem like a good target
2020-04-13 19:20:37 <kspalaiologos> C is hard to optimize by the compiler
2020-04-13 19:20:42 <kspalaiologos> you can't even reassociate math
2020-04-13 19:20:48 <zzo38> You could also allow it to support multiple targets
2020-04-13 19:20:49 <kspalaiologos> without changing behaviour of some snippets
2020-04-13 19:21:03 <kspalaiologos> zzo38, not today, that's too much effort :P, I'll maybe support C later on
2020-04-13 19:21:10 <ais523> (for people who are wondering, take a couple of 128-bit registers, store intermediate results there, and then write them using nontemporal writes; this is fastest even though GPR→vector register copies are documented as slow)
2020-04-13 19:21:33 <ais523> (oddly, this was fastest even though the CPU had 256-bit registers available)
2020-04-13 19:21:55 <kspalaiologos> it's always cheering to see a fellow assembly programmer
2020-04-13 19:21:55 <arseniiv> <kspalaiologos> python doesn't seem like a good target => for production code, I more or less agree, but for quick proof-of-concept things why not
2020-04-13 19:22:11 <kspalaiologos> ^ yeah, for a proof of concept python is sufficient
2020-04-13 19:22:33 <arseniiv> assembly programmers are magicians
2020-04-13 19:22:56 <kspalaiologos> Malbolge programmers are true magicians
2020-04-13 19:23:09 <arseniiv> as any true magician, an assembly master is a rare sight
2020-04-13 19:23:09 <ais523> I don't write in asm much, but I think it's an important language to know, especially when trying to work out how to write the quickest possible code
2020-04-13 19:23:26 <kspalaiologos> seducers, thiefs, simonists
2020-04-13 19:23:29 <ais523> I consider asm to be a fairly easy language to write (if you aren't aiming for performance), incidentally, it's just really time-consuming
2020-04-13 19:23:45 <kspalaiologos> that's true
2020-04-13 19:24:01 <arseniiv> <kspalaiologos> Malbolge programmers are true magicians => hmhm maybe they are abstract theoretical magicians then, and assembly ones, practicing ones ;D
2020-04-13 19:24:01 <kspalaiologos> writing my Assembly implementation for the Seed generator has been a quite long process

2020-04-13 19:29:24 <arseniiv> though in view of wanting to call myself a bit of a magician too I need to postulate Haskell-or-other programmers should be magicians too, just of a school almost incompatible in its workings to an assembly ones. It’s even plain to see: an assembly magician assembles (with others) and a haskell one, well, “has call”, which might mean that they can talk to one another at a distance, which is quite a good trait these times. I’ll
2020-04-13 19:29:24 <arseniiv> how myself out
2020-04-13 19:30:22 <zzo38> There are different assembly language for different computers and VMs, so you might know one way better than other one.

2020-04-13 20:11:14 <zzo38> That isn't very good, they should write (Y/N) instead
2020-04-13 20:12:49 <kmc> you cancelled the cancelling
2020-04-13 20:13:24 <kmc> i agree with zzo38, that isn't very good

2020-04-13 20:15:12 <int-e> (But are those labels provided by the JS code or by the browser, hmm.)
2020-04-13 20:15:34 <int-e> aww @xkcd
2020-04-13 20:16:56 <arseniiv> can a cell cancel
2020-04-13 20:18:19 <zzo38> If it is in the browser and is provided by a JavaScript prompt() function, then that isn't a problem, since they just have to make the expectation (although maybe they should put labels true/false). If it is a confirmation the browser puts by itself, perhaps due to an altered but not yet submitted form (this would be a better way, subject to user configuration), then it should use better writing.
2020-04-13 20:21:55 <arseniiv> yeah, this xkcd is poetic. A glider ensouled takes into the sky and expands the boundaries of life
2020-04-13 20:23:26 <arseniiv> though maybe it doesn’t quite reach the surreal, and that’s a pity

2020-04-13 20:32:22 <arseniiv> int-e: hmmm the idea is nice but I don’t know if it would be linked to surreal numbers by many
2020-04-13 20:34:09 <kmc> i kind of thought it would break out of the frame
2020-04-13 20:35:34 <int-e> I was wrong, this isn't actually happening on github (which phrases the message differently); it's just its sibling, gist.
2020-04-13 20:38:19 <int-e> Huh. Can't reproduce? Maybe my brain read something that wasn't there. In that case... let me get back on the project of detonating the Sun to erase all evidence of this ever happening.

2020-04-13 20:43:22 <arseniiv> hm yes I still haven’t learned this language
2020-04-13 20:43:48 <ais523> for example, it uses the three-word phrase "will declaratively refresh" as though it were a single-word noun
2020-04-13 20:44:07 <ais523> e.g. "If document's will declaratively refresh is true, then return."
2020-04-13 20:44:21 <int-e> arseniiv: Yes, it is mentioned in there.
2020-04-13 20:44:55 <ais523> which, given that most of the document is written in pseudocode, I'm not even sure I can argue that this is wrong because variable names can be anything without changing the meaning

2020-04-13 20:50:24 <ais523> (otherwise, you just cancel and have an "undo cancel" button, which is 100% clear)
2020-04-13 20:50:31 <arseniiv> ah, so I need to distract you with blowing up Sagittarius A* after all
2020-04-13 20:50:43 <arseniiv> int-e: ^
2020-04-13 20:51:17 <ais523> that might be a fun question for the user interface design stack exchange
2020-04-13 20:51:32 <ais523> I think nowadays my main usage of stack exchange is asking ridiculously hard questions that I don't expect there to be a good answer to
2020-04-13 20:51:37 <zzo38> I think (Y/N) is best, but that is not applicable to HTML. I suggested displaying true/false if the confirm() function is used.
2020-04-13 20:51:45 <zzo38> Since, those are the return values of the confirm() function.
2020-04-13 20:51:53 <ais523> (nothing is lost if I'm right, but something amazing often happens when I'm wrong, so the overall expectation is very positive)
2020-04-13 20:52:09 <int-e> I'm really miffed about not being able to reproduce it, and not knowing whether it's a corner case or something I just imagined.
2020-04-13 20:52:47 <int-e> Not enough to go diving into github's code, but it's kind of a close call.
2020-04-13 20:54:32 <arseniiv> int-e: I tried to cancel editing my own comment now at my gist, and it asks “Are you sure you want to discard your unsaved changes?” with OK and Cancel (translated) buttons
2020-04-13 20:54:53 <arseniiv> is it what you think you have seen?
2020-04-13 20:56:28 <arseniiv> ah, btw the browser is Firefox and the dialog is seemingly by Firefox, so it should be a standard JS function being used, yep
2020-04-13 20:57:19 <int-e> arseniiv: That is what I'm seeing when I try to reproduce the problem :P
2020-04-13 20:57:38 <arseniiv> ah sorry
2020-04-13 20:57:44 <int-e> arseniiv: But it's not what I thought I saw.
2020-04-13 20:58:01 <int-e> arseniiv: Don't worry. It's nice to get *something* right. :P
2020-04-13 20:58:15 <arseniiv> though at least what you see instead is more reproducible that it was known prior
2020-04-13 20:59:18 <arseniiv> int-e: *something* right => then not the Sun, Sagittarius A*
2020-04-13 21:03:08 <esowiki> 14[[07User:PythonshellDebugwindow/Sandbox14]]4 M10 02https://esolangs.org/w/index.php?diff=71003&oldid=70994 5* 03PythonshellDebugwindow 5* (+859) 10
2020-04-13 21:04:29 <int-e> arseniiv: Nah, I also try to keep my goals realistic. If I'm to shoot at stars, I'll start with the Sun.
2020-04-13 21:05:06 <arseniiv> still, I have some time to dissuade you
2020-04-13 21:05:44 <int-e> Perhaps so, but all you're accomplishing is to strengthen my resolve.
2020-04-13 21:09:04 <arseniiv> int-e: hmm it came to my mind if I blow up Sgt A* first (and in the right way), you woudn’t get a chance with the Sun… hm
2020-04-13 21:10:08 <arseniiv> though this is a goal no less distant to me too, so I’m just musing alound
2020-04-13 21:10:58 <arseniiv> though no, I should pick Betelgeuse
2020-04-13 21:11:18 <ais523> are there any natural languages where the natural translations of "yes" and "no" start with the same letter?
2020-04-13 21:30:12 <fizzie> A table on the Internet says that in the Bambara language (which is "mostly written in the Latin script") those are Awɔ and Ayi respectively. But another dictionary page writes the yes as "ɔwɔ", and there is an uppercase Ɔ as well, so maybe not. It does seem to be a different vowel, at least.
2020-04-13 21:34:18 <fizzie> The Hawaiian ʻae (yes) and ʻaʻole (no) might count. (I don't know any of these languages, just guessing.)

2020-04-13 21:49:45 <zzo38> The user interface guidelines are perhaps no good then. What is done in vi is better, you must type :q! if you want to discard your changes, if you type :q and there are unsaved changes, it tell you that you must type :q! instead if you want to discard the unsaved changes or :w to save changes, or :wq to save and quit.

2020-04-13 22:25:15 <ais523> zzo38: that's a good solution for a command-line interface
2020-04-13 22:26:09 <ais523> hmm, the best dialog button names I can think of for this are "Confirm cancel" and "Continue, don't cancel"
2020-04-13 22:27:42 <zzo38> Perhaps "discard" and "continue editing" (and possibly also "save changes")
2020-04-13 22:30:19 <ais523> zzo38: if it's just for an editor, then yes, that's the standard
2020-04-13 22:32:16 <zzo38> Yes. For other things, there is other stuff. Such as, if an operating is processing and then will be completed by itself in time, to put: Copying interrupted. Push space to resume copying or ^C to cancel copying.
2020-04-13 22:48:08 <zzo38> Maybe the overspill for reconnaissance should be you can look at the top card of any player's regular pile.
2020-04-13 22:50:25 <zzo38> (You cannot look at the card underneath the top card even if you have more than one reconnaissance, but if you have two reconnaissances then you can look at both your own and your opponent's card.)
