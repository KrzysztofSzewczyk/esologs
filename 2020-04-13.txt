2020-04-13 00:48:13 <zzo38> One idea I thought of for Magic: the Gathering, is there is meld to make a single object from two objects, which are then two objects again when it leaves the battlefield, so I thought the other way would be something that causes the card to become two objects once it enters the battlefield, and then moving either or both of them causes it to become a single object again.
2020-04-13 00:51:34 <zzo38> That is even more confusing, I think, but perhaps rules can be written which can work.
2020-04-13 00:55:04 <zzo38> I thought, each half can have different characteristics, timestamps, controller, counters, status, damage, etc, but never different owners or zone.
