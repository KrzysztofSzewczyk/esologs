2020-10-03 00:39:49 <int-e> WTF... https://www.lifewire.com/strong-password-examples-2483118 lists "BankLogin!3" as an excellent password...
2020-10-03 00:42:36 <shachaf> I think maybe I should ban digits and "special characters" in passwords.
2020-10-03 00:42:57 <shachaf> They make passwords harder to remember and probably don't meaningfully increase entropy?
2020-10-03 00:43:10 <int-e> They make them quicker to type though
2020-10-03 00:43:49 <zzo38> I think you should not ban anything except perhaps null characters and some control characters (depending on the application). However, you should not require digits and "special characters" either. And, please do not set the maximum length too small!
2020-10-03 00:43:56 <int-e> And they add some bits of entropy if they're not l33t-derived.
2020-10-03 00:44:38 <shachaf> Maybe it should just be a-z
2020-10-03 00:44:46 <zzo38> Arbitrary octets should otherwise be allowed in the password.
2020-10-03 00:44:47 <shachaf> I guess allowing capital letters is one bit per character.

2020-10-03 00:45:16 <shachaf> I guess I could've guessed that one.
2020-10-03 00:45:37 <int-e> capital letters... I'd imagine for most people they add one bit per word.

2020-10-03 00:45:58 <shachaf> Presumably this is a pretty good password.
2020-10-03 00:46:20 <int-e> (and yes, people will use words if you let them)
2020-10-03 00:46:43 <int-e> I wonder what word list b_jonas used.
2020-10-03 00:46:51 <shachaf> Maybe you shouldn't let people choose passwords.
2020-10-03 00:46:55 <zzo38> Well, some people will. Some people use numbers instead.
2020-10-03 00:47:08 <shachaf> Just generate a 70-bit 15-character password and let them regenerate on demand.
2020-10-03 00:47:08 <int-e> (I suspect this is one of his serious entries... so it's bound to be 16 actually random words.)
2020-10-03 00:47:49 <zzo38> I think that you should let people choose passwords, but ensure the maximum length is sufficiently long (I suggest at least sixty bytes, probably more). A random password option might be good too, though, maybe.
2020-10-03 00:48:03 <int-e> It's not diceware.
2020-10-03 00:48:31 <int-e> 60 bytes.
2020-10-03 00:48:35 <int-e> Good one, good one.

2020-10-03 00:49:00 <Arcorann> 60 bytes would be overkill for random passwords though

2020-10-03 00:49:22 <int-e> it's also a pretty useless metric
2020-10-03 00:49:24 <zzo38> Arcorann: Yes, but I only specified that as a maximum length, not the minimum or default length.
2020-10-03 00:49:31 <int-e> oh
2020-10-03 00:49:35 <int-e> my bad, I misread.
2020-10-03 00:49:39 <Arcorann> Same...
2020-10-03 00:50:10 <int-e> or rather, made an assumption because hardly anybody speaks of maximum password lengths... minimum lengths are all the rage
2020-10-03 00:50:13 <zzo38> (If you can, increase the maximum length to more than that.)
2020-10-03 00:50:47 <Arcorann> Maximum length restrictions beyond those required to avoid extreme processing times shouldn't be necessary in any sensible password scheme
2020-10-03 00:51:09 <shachaf> int-e: That page also says that "BankLogin" is an OK password.
2020-10-03 00:51:39 <int-e> shachaf: Yeah, it's wholly embarrassing.
2020-10-03 00:51:50 <int-e> Designed to make people feel good about their passwords, I'm sure.
2020-10-03 00:52:09 <shachaf> It also says that "kitty" is an OK password.
2020-10-03 00:52:24 <shachaf> Despite saying a bit above that such a password is incredibly insecure.
2020-10-03 00:52:29 <zzo38> Arcorann: Yes, that is true. (Well, not only time but also memory. And depending on the program, it may display asterisks as it is being typed and there may be limited space on the display, but you can also conceal the password entirely (like traditionally in UNIX-based systems), display on multiple lines, use smaller fonts, etc.)
2020-10-03 00:52:30 <shachaf> I guess "OK" is a euphemism?
2020-10-03 00:52:34 <int-e> I didn't read it all.

2020-10-03 00:53:46 <Arcorann> Probably shouldn't have called it "OK", but yeah the mechanism of "take a dictionary word and add special characters or numbers" is not great
2020-10-03 00:53:55 <shachaf> I think a random word in /[a-z]{15}/ is pretty good.
2020-10-03 00:54:08 <shachaf> Do I want more than 70 bits?
2020-10-03 00:54:11 <zzo38> oren: Yes, that can work.

2020-10-03 00:56:49 <shachaf> How many bits do you get from that?
2020-10-03 00:57:03 <shachaf> If it's a password you type regularly, saving on characters is probably good.
2020-10-03 00:57:06 <shachaf> I mean on keystrokes.
2020-10-03 00:57:14 <shachaf> Shift is an extra keystroke.
2020-10-03 00:57:23 <int-e> https://xkcd.com/936/ said 44 bits

2020-10-03 00:59:15 <Arcorann> Nowadays I get KeePass to generate my passwords except for a few that I've memorised
2020-10-03 01:01:06 <shachaf> 44 bits is presumably OK if you know the password is being stored securely with a fancy KDF.
2020-10-03 01:01:17 <shachaf> But if you don't then you probably want more.
2020-10-03 01:01:23 <shachaf> Is 70 even enough?
2020-10-03 01:03:27 <int-e> 70 is plenty
2020-10-03 01:05:19 <int-e> I usually look at this... Bitcoin is at 2^47 hashes per second.
2020-10-03 01:06:25 <shachaf> Isn't it way more than that?

2020-10-03 01:07:31 <int-e> Okay, fine.
2020-10-03 01:07:41 <int-e> I can't do ISO :-(
2020-10-03 01:07:54 <shachaf> ISO?
2020-10-03 01:07:54 <int-e> Or SI for that matter.
2020-10-03 01:08:50 <int-e> Okay, so maybe 70 is only plenty if it's not stored as a plain hash.
2020-10-03 01:22:21 <int-e> (Oh well. The SI/ISO mixup isn't new, at least. But getting the prefixes wrong is.)
2020-10-03 01:23:07 <shachaf> Oh, the number you gave was 140e12.
2020-10-03 01:23:18 <shachaf> I think it's confusilating of them to give numbers in millions of terahashes.
2020-10-03 01:23:39 <shachaf> Either give hashes or exashes or something.
