2020-08-25 00:20:19 <Sgeo> zzo38, do you have any thoughts about the Gemini protocol? (I feel like someone asked you that before, but I only learned of Gemini today, because of a mention of a client being written in Racket)

2020-08-25 00:25:27 <Sgeo> Hmm https://gemini.circumlunar.space/clients.html looks more styled than is possible for a text/gemini document
2020-08-25 00:25:38 <Sgeo> (Text other than the link on the same line as the link)
2020-08-25 00:42:20 <Sgeo> Hmm, I think I'd prefer if the MIME type and whether it's likely to initiate a query was part of a URL
2020-08-25 00:42:59 <Sgeo> GemiNaut seems to try to guess that say, a link is to an image, but it has to be a guess (unless it's prefetching which it shouldn't be)
2020-08-25 00:52:46 <zzo38> Sgeo: I did try it on the ssh. One thing that I think of Gemini is that there should be a unencrypted version, perhaps "pgemini://" (the default can be encrypted; that is fine).
2020-08-25 00:53:06 <zzo38> If you prefer the type and if it initiates a query to be a part of the URL, there is Gopher, which does that.
