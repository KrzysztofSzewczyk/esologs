2019-11-30 00:11:00 <Sgeo> I'm watching a video about surreal numbers, and it said every real number is surrounded by an island of infinitesimals called a "monad". Any relation to the other meaning of monad that Haskell stole from category theory?
2019-11-30 00:12:07 <kingoffrance> i prefer the devils dictionary definitions of "monad" "molecule" "corpsucle" etc.
2019-11-30 00:12:34 <kingoffrance> "the smallest individual unit of matter; see also:  x, also the smallest individual unit of matter; distinguished from y, also the smallest individual unit of matter"  etc.
2019-11-30 00:12:52 <kingoffrance> the ion differs from the corpsucle in that it is an ion, etc.
2019-11-30 00:14:47 <kingoffrance> "leibniz has founded a theory of the universe based on the monad, but the creature bears no resentment, for the monad is a gentleman"
2019-11-30 00:14:51 <fizzie> "It is of course well known that all ships of space are propelled by the inert projection, by means of high-potential static fields, of nascent fourth-order particles or “corpuscles,” which are formed, inert, inside the inertialess projector, by the conversion of some form of energy into matter."
