2019-11-30 00:11:00 <Sgeo> I'm watching a video about surreal numbers, and it said every real number is surrounded by an island of infinitesimals called a "monad". Any relation to the other meaning of monad that Haskell stole from category theory?
2019-11-30 00:12:07 <kingoffrance> i prefer the devils dictionary definitions of "monad" "molecule" "corpsucle" etc.
2019-11-30 00:12:34 <kingoffrance> "the smallest individual unit of matter; see also:  x, also the smallest individual unit of matter; distinguished from y, also the smallest individual unit of matter"  etc.
2019-11-30 00:12:52 <kingoffrance> the ion differs from the corpsucle in that it is an ion, etc.
2019-11-30 00:14:47 <kingoffrance> "leibniz has founded a theory of the universe based on the monad, but the creature bears no resentment, for the monad is a gentleman"
2019-11-30 00:14:51 <fizzie> "It is of course well known that all ships of space are propelled by the inert projection, by means of high-potential static fields, of nascent fourth-order particles or “corpuscles,” which are formed, inert, inside the inertialess projector, by the conversion of some form of energy into matter."

2019-11-30 00:34:04 <Lykaina> fizzie: you know you are descriping a zero-point engine, right?
2019-11-30 00:34:38 <Lykaina> corpuscles == electrons
2019-11-30 00:34:59 <kingoffrance> i forgot the atom, also the smallest indivisible unit of matter :/
2019-11-30 00:36:53 <Lykaina> kingoffrance: atoms ain't indivisible
2019-11-30 00:37:34 <zzo38> Yes, but nevertheless they call it "atoms" because it is indivisible, even though it isn't.
2019-11-30 00:37:48 <Lykaina> they thought they were
2019-11-30 00:38:06 <Lykaina> then the manhattan project happened
2019-11-30 00:41:58 <Lykaina> is there anything observable smaller than gluons?
2019-11-30 00:42:24 <Lykaina> i'm pretty sure strings aren't observable yet
2019-11-30 00:44:33 <kingoffrance> well, that book was circa 1880s-1910s  -ish  IIRC

2019-11-30 00:49:27 <Lykaina> e e "doc" smith
2019-11-30 00:49:35 <Lykaina> lensman series
2019-11-30 00:50:59 <fizzie> Yes. It's not always just old terms, though, it's also curious mishmash of concepts.
2019-11-30 00:51:15 <fizzie> I mean, it's all about the ether (and sub-ether) waves too.
2019-11-30 00:55:04 <fizzie> And that whole negasphere business, which is most of the time pretty close to antimatter, but with a some degree of black-holeness thrown in too.
2019-11-30 00:57:06 <fizzie> You make it by feeding a whole bunch of regular matter into a singularity, and it's "not essentially three-dimensional in nature. Light sank into the thing, whatever it was, and vanished."
2019-11-30 00:57:14 <fizzie> But then later: "For, as has been said, the negasphere was composed of negative matter. Instead of electrons its building-blocks were positrons—the “Dirac holes” in an infinity of negative energy." And it's seen to annihilate regular matter "with nothing save a burst of invisible cosmics to mark its passing."
2019-11-30 00:57:47 <fizzie> Anyway, I like best the parts where it's completely failing to anticipate these things called computers. I think I've quoted the parts already here.
2019-11-30 00:58:07 <fizzie> "For eight hours two hundred Rigellians stood at whining calculators, each solving course-and-distance problems at the rate of ten per minute."
2019-11-30 00:58:49 <fizzie> "Then for hours bale after bale of cards went through the machine; thousands of records per minute. Occasionally one card would flip out into a rack, rejected." (They're trying to filter out a top N list of scientists out of a library's stack of index cards.)
2019-11-30 01:00:17 <fizzie> On space ship navigation: "-- her graduated circles and vernier scales were of a size and a fineness usually seen only in the great vessels of the Galactic Survey."
2019-11-30 01:01:46 <fizzie> And smaller calculations are always being performed on slip-sticks (AIUI, colloquialism for a slide rule).
2019-11-30 01:11:01 <Lykaina> transistors were not yet invented
2019-11-30 01:12:54 <Lykaina> in the story i am writing, much of computer tech was based on the roswell crash
2019-11-30 01:14:17 <kingoffrance> thats another futurama
2019-11-30 01:14:25 <kingoffrance> more or less
2019-11-30 01:14:54 <Lykaina> no it's not
2019-11-30 01:15:54 <Lykaina> it's similar to something in an episode of star trek: voyager, though
2019-11-30 01:16:55 <Lykaina> but i consider my version to be significantly different

2019-11-30 01:34:27 <fizzie> Hm. "Writing to /dev/random or /dev/urandom will update the entropy pool with the data written, but this will not result in a higher entropy count. This means that it will impact the contents read from both files, but it will not make reads from /dev/random faster."
2019-11-30 01:34:54 <fizzie> I was hoping I could've fixed the HackEso lack of entropy by making init write a bunch of random bytes from the host into /dev/random.

2019-11-30 02:36:51 <fizzie> http://ix.io/239O not sure why adding 128 bytes increases the entropy count by 384 bits, but at least it's doing something.
2019-11-30 02:37:48 <fizzie> Adding 512 bytes bumps the estimate up to 2176. The first was exactly 3 bits/byte, this is exactly 4.25 bits/byte.
2019-11-30 02:38:01 <fizzie> Presumably there's some sort of a computation. But that should be good enough.

2019-11-30 03:46:51 <kingoffrance> or gcc IIRC has #include_next  i guess, inspired from next/apple gcc objective-c feature IIRC;     yeah, basically it can be done on purpose, or headers are typically guarded to protect against it
2019-11-30 03:47:18 <imode> i.e "I define flag A, include header A, which includes code snippet A because flag A is defined, then I undefine flag A, then I define flag B, then include header A again, which has snippet B.." etc.
2019-11-30 03:47:35 <kingoffrance> people doing more-than-basic macro stuff it might be more common
2019-11-30 03:48:20 <kingoffrance> someone like me, you might split all functions into separate .c,  and then just have a single "all.c" or similar that pulls in the others
2019-11-30 03:48:37 <kingoffrance> but i dont really see that done,  command lines typically have wildcards:   gcc *.c   -o foo
2019-11-30 03:48:59 <imode> yeah including .c files I don't see very often.
2019-11-30 03:49:09 <kingoffrance> sometimes people do one giant "all.h" that pulls in all the other, so that is somewhat common i think if people get fed up of order to include things in
2019-11-30 03:49:37 <kingoffrance> i think plan9  kind of did that too, don't recall
2019-11-30 03:49:41 <kingoffrance> (never used it)
2019-11-30 03:50:15 <imode> I do that with a lot of projects.
2019-11-30 03:50:19 <kingoffrance> or "windows.h" from what i have heard is somewhat of that nature,  so much so that there is a WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN something or other to only include portions
2019-11-30 03:50:27 <imode> not named "all.h" but usually "<project>.h"
2019-11-30 03:50:32 <kmc> xmacros!
2019-11-30 03:51:02 <fizzie> SQLite does that 'amalgamation' build, though not through the preprocessor.
2019-11-30 03:52:36 <fizzie> I tend to use xmacros without multi-file setups. It's just #define DATA X(a) X(b) ... X(z) #define X(x) ... DATA #undef X #define X(x) ... DATA #undef X.
2019-11-30 03:52:54 <kingoffrance> well, i strayed a bit, but generally i guess includes are annoying enough on their own sometimes, i dont see much "include multiple times magic"
2019-11-30 03:53:15 <kingoffrance> esoteric or obfuscated stuff however, might be a whole nother story
2019-11-30 03:54:21 <kingoffrance> the only time i suppose that has ever came up with me, is circular definitions e.g. structs that refer to eachother;  i believe with header guards that is not a problem, they can "include" eachother;  "forward declaration" i believe is the term
2019-11-30 03:54:37 <imode> if you want horrific preprocessor abuse, the Mode-to-C translator is just translating Mode instructions to C preprocessor tokens, which get expanded inline.
2019-11-30 03:55:04 <imode> very much like generating C from brainfuck.
2019-11-30 03:55:15 <fizzie> The sort of things that a C++ author would use templates for sometimes do get done using a "template" included with different macros in place. But since the original question was "how common", it's probably fair enough to say "not common at all".
2019-11-30 03:56:45 <kmc> fizzie: wait, how does the single-file solution work?
2019-11-30 03:57:25 <kingoffrance> there are lots of (especially pre-posix probably) code with #defines   that basically include things in a specific order, for some OS,   so sometimes they have a comment /* ok to include twice, needed for X */    or /* ancient OS does not like this being included twice */   but that again, is more working around vendor headers, than deliberately including something some number of times
2019-11-30 03:59:18 <kingoffrance> and the opposite case is probably more likely:  os A foo.h includes bar.h   so programmer knows this and only includes foo.h,   then this breaks when they compile somewhere that isnt true;    so they wanted something included once and got zero times instead
2019-11-30 04:11:15 <zzo38> Something I have is that a macro is defined in a different way when the file is included, such as the Opt macro used in bystand_options.inc
2019-11-30 04:12:48 <zzo38> Once it is included in a enum block and is defined as Opt_##x, and once it is included in an array and Opt is defined as #x,
2019-11-30 04:14:45 <fizzie> kmc: Maybe better with newlines:  #define DATA X(a) X(b) ... X(z) \ #define X(x) ... \ DATA \ #undef X \ #define X(x) ... \ DATA \ #undef X
2019-11-30 04:14:53 <fizzie> It's just the same as the usual thing, except instead of #include "data.x" you expand the macro DATA.
2019-11-30 04:16:43 <fizzie> Maybe better for a moderate amount of items. For very many, the separate file is probably more readable.
2019-11-30 04:27:06 <shachaf> Header guards might be scow.
2019-11-30 04:28:15 <shachaf> Anyway, putting all your code in one translation unit is where it's at.
2019-11-30 04:31:40 <zzo38> Often I do use a single file for a program, although sometimes separate files are helpful for various purposes, whether they are all included into one file or compiled separately, both ways are useful for different purposes.
2019-11-30 04:43:28 <kingoffrance> actually univ. of utah "cmi" cross-module inliner basically did that "put all code in one translation unit"   theory was it could inline and eliminate <things not actually used> so youd get a smaller, more efficient binary;  it was compiler-independent, but written in haskell IIRC ghc old version so might be a pain to get running nowadays (and now gcc and clang and intel c at least, all have some type of "Link-Time Optimization" a
2019-11-30 04:43:28 <kingoffrance> nd profiler-based optimizations too, etc.)
2019-11-30 04:44:35 <kingoffrance> it was part of a larger oskit project IIRC, that is basically not maintained to my knowledge,  that added various things to C like "module" system of some sort
2019-11-30 04:46:40 <kingoffrance> (but not preprocessor independent; iirc youd preprocess your files, then it would "merge" them into one giant thing, with things appearing in the order it thought best, and youd compile that)
2019-11-30 04:47:29 <kingoffrance> (IIRC it had to deal with whatever junk various preprocessors would insert for some compiler, that were perhaps non-standard)
2019-11-30 04:47:45 <kingoffrance> (or system headers that are non-standard for some specific compiler, etc.)
2019-11-30 04:48:44 <kingoffrance> (so itself IIRC was compiler-independent, but headers and preprocessors are not necessarily so)
2019-11-30 04:49:57 <kingoffrance> (it might still be useful if you use old gcc versions perhaps)
2019-11-30 04:54:24 <kmc> fizzie: ah, i see
