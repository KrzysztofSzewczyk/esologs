2019-11-30 00:03:32 <fizzie> Completely unrelated, but there's also strdup/strndup support.

2019-11-30 00:11:00 <Sgeo> I'm watching a video about surreal numbers, and it said every real number is surrounded by an island of infinitesimals called a "monad". Any relation to the other meaning of monad that Haskell stole from category theory?
2019-11-30 00:12:07 <kingoffrance> i prefer the devils dictionary definitions of "monad" "molecule" "corpsucle" etc.
2019-11-30 00:12:34 <kingoffrance> "the smallest individual unit of matter; see also:  x, also the smallest individual unit of matter; distinguished from y, also the smallest individual unit of matter"  etc.
2019-11-30 00:12:52 <kingoffrance> the ion differs from the corpsucle in that it is an ion, etc.
2019-11-30 00:14:47 <kingoffrance> "leibniz has founded a theory of the universe based on the monad, but the creature bears no resentment, for the monad is a gentleman"
2019-11-30 00:14:51 <fizzie> "It is of course well known that all ships of space are propelled by the inert projection, by means of high-potential static fields, of nascent fourth-order particles or “corpuscles,” which are formed, inert, inside the inertialess projector, by the conversion of some form of energy into matter."

2019-11-30 00:34:04 <Lykaina> fizzie: you know you are descriping a zero-point engine, right?
2019-11-30 00:34:38 <Lykaina> corpuscles == electrons
2019-11-30 00:34:59 <kingoffrance> i forgot the atom, also the smallest indivisible unit of matter :/
2019-11-30 00:36:53 <Lykaina> kingoffrance: atoms ain't indivisible
2019-11-30 00:37:34 <zzo38> Yes, but nevertheless they call it "atoms" because it is indivisible, even though it isn't.
2019-11-30 00:37:48 <Lykaina> they thought they were
2019-11-30 00:38:06 <Lykaina> then the manhattan project happened
2019-11-30 00:41:58 <Lykaina> is there anything observable smaller than gluons?
2019-11-30 00:42:24 <Lykaina> i'm pretty sure strings aren't observable yet
2019-11-30 00:44:33 <kingoffrance> well, that book was circa 1880s-1910s  -ish  IIRC
2019-11-30 00:44:57 <kingoffrance> i have yet to see a worthy competitor, although people write field-specific variants
2019-11-30 00:45:00 <Lykaina> which?
2019-11-30 00:45:14 <Lykaina> devil's dictionary?
2019-11-30 00:45:20 <kingoffrance> yes
2019-11-30 00:45:40 <Lykaina> what was fizzie quoting from?
2019-11-30 00:45:50 <kingoffrance> theres a devils dp (data processing) but noone calls it that anymore;  i dunno fizzie
2019-11-30 00:46:55 <Lykaina> cause that's a zero-point reactor
2019-11-30 00:48:02 <Lykaina> just using old terms
2019-11-30 00:49:06 <Lykaina> oh...galactic patrol
2019-11-30 00:49:10 <kingoffrance> fizzies thing sounded like something i heard on futurama cartoon

2019-11-30 00:49:27 <Lykaina> e e "doc" smith
2019-11-30 00:49:35 <Lykaina> lensman series
2019-11-30 00:50:59 <fizzie> Yes. It's not always just old terms, though, it's also curious mishmash of concepts.
2019-11-30 00:51:15 <fizzie> I mean, it's all about the ether (and sub-ether) waves too.
2019-11-30 00:55:04 <fizzie> And that whole negasphere business, which is most of the time pretty close to antimatter, but with a some degree of black-holeness thrown in too.
2019-11-30 00:57:06 <fizzie> You make it by feeding a whole bunch of regular matter into a singularity, and it's "not essentially three-dimensional in nature. Light sank into the thing, whatever it was, and vanished."
2019-11-30 00:57:14 <fizzie> But then later: "For, as has been said, the negasphere was composed of negative matter. Instead of electrons its building-blocks were positrons—the “Dirac holes” in an infinity of negative energy." And it's seen to annihilate regular matter "with nothing save a burst of invisible cosmics to mark its passing."
2019-11-30 00:57:47 <fizzie> Anyway, I like best the parts where it's completely failing to anticipate these things called computers. I think I've quoted the parts already here.
2019-11-30 00:58:07 <fizzie> "For eight hours two hundred Rigellians stood at whining calculators, each solving course-and-distance problems at the rate of ten per minute."
2019-11-30 00:58:49 <fizzie> "Then for hours bale after bale of cards went through the machine; thousands of records per minute. Occasionally one card would flip out into a rack, rejected." (They're trying to filter out a top N list of scientists out of a library's stack of index cards.)
2019-11-30 01:00:17 <fizzie> On space ship navigation: "-- her graduated circles and vernier scales were of a size and a fineness usually seen only in the great vessels of the Galactic Survey."
2019-11-30 01:01:46 <fizzie> And smaller calculations are always being performed on slip-sticks (AIUI, colloquialism for a slide rule).
2019-11-30 01:11:01 <Lykaina> transistors were not yet invented
2019-11-30 01:12:54 <Lykaina> in the story i am writing, much of computer tech was based on the roswell crash
2019-11-30 01:14:17 <kingoffrance> thats another futurama
2019-11-30 01:14:25 <kingoffrance> more or less
2019-11-30 01:14:54 <Lykaina> no it's not
2019-11-30 01:15:54 <Lykaina> it's similar to something in an episode of star trek: voyager, though
2019-11-30 01:16:55 <Lykaina> but i consider my version to be significantly different

2019-11-30 01:34:27 <fizzie> Hm. "Writing to /dev/random or /dev/urandom will update the entropy pool with the data written, but this will not result in a higher entropy count. This means that it will impact the contents read from both files, but it will not make reads from /dev/random faster."
2019-11-30 01:34:54 <fizzie> I was hoping I could've fixed the HackEso lack of entropy by making init write a bunch of random bytes from the host into /dev/random.
2019-11-30 01:36:24 <int-e> oerjan: you predicted a Sturmhalten reference
2019-11-30 01:37:01 <fizzie> Hm, apparently you can, it just needs to be done using ioctl RNDADDENTROPY instead of just writing.
